# Basic Segmentation

The **Basic Segmentation** option allows you to create unique combinations of conditions to filter customers accordingly. 

For example, if a clothing company with an eCommerce site wants to filter its customers ranging from age 14 to 30 in Canada. They could filter customers for the required age range. 

The following explains how you can create basic segmentation:
 
**Step 1:** Log in to your <a href = https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/ target=_blank>**Admin Console**</a> account and navigate to <a href = https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/profile-management/customer-segmentation/basic-segmentation target=_blank>**Profile Management > Customer Segmentation**</a>.
 
The following screen will appear:
