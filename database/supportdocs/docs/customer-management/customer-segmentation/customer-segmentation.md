# Customer Segmentation

The **Customer Segmentation** feature allows you to query your customer data and then download the resultant data in CSV or JSON formats. The purpose of the customer segmentation feature is to allow you to filter customers to perform the required analysis.

> **Note:** By default Customer Segmentation feature is disabled, If you want to enable this feature contact [LoginRadius support](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/support/tickets/open-a-new-ticket).


You can create customer segmentations in the following two ways:

- [Basic Segmentation](#basicsegmentation0)
- [Advanced Segmentation](#advancedsegmentation1)


## [Basic Segmentation](/customer-management/customer-segmentation/basic-segmentation)

Create unique combinations of conditions to filter customers meeting this specific criteria. For example, letâ€™s consider a tea company with an ecommerce site that wants to understand their older, working professional customers in Canada. They could filter customers from Canada above the age of 35 but younger than 65.

At the bottom of the page is the total number of customers plus the number of customers matching the chosen criteria. Export this segmented data as a csv file.

## [Advanced Segmentation](/customer-management/customer-segmentation/advanced-segmentation)

In addition to the functionality of Basic Segmentation, Advanced Segmentation allows you to filter with Groups or JSON code segmentation. Create filters with more refined criteria and use this information to target specific customer groups. For example, if the tea company wanted to include older, working professional customers from Canada and France, they would also have to account for different retirement age conventions in each country. If people in France can retire earlier (e.g. 62), they could filter customers from France above 35 but younger than 62, and customers from Canada above 35 but younger than 65.

Like Basic Segmentation, the bottom of the page shows the total number of customers plus the number of customers matching the chosen criteria. Export this segmented data as a csv file.


In addition, you can view and access the list of saved segments, as explained in the [**Saved Segmentation**](/customer-management/customer-segmentation/save-segmentation/) tab.
