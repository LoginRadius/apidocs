## How Do I Export My User Data?

While LoginRadius stores, organizes and can be integrated to seamlessly feed data into other systems you may be using, one of the most common question we are asked is "how can I download a file of my user data?"

  
With the LoginRadius Data Export Feature, you are able to request a one-time export or schedule recurring exports.

  
To get started, you will need to first log in to the LoginRadius dashboard and navigate to the Data Export area, which you will find under the Integrations tab.

> Note: 
> 1.  LoginRadius uses UTC time standard for all data export request.
> 2.  You can export a maximum of 1 million records in a single export request.
> 3.  CSV export is limited to a specific number of fields but if you are looking to export the complete profile with all fields, please go with the JSON export.
    

There are two available options for Data Export:

- [On-Demand Export](/integrations/user-data-export/on-demand-export/)

- [Scheduled Export](/integrations/user-data-export/scheduled-export/)
    

## On-Demand Export

The On-Demand Export area will allow you to request a one-time export of your user data.

## Scheduled Export

The Scheduled Export area will allow you to request a Recurring, Scheduled Export of your user data.

## Export Logs

Download the Data Export from [Export Logs](/integrations/user-data-export/export-logs/) within LoginRadius Admin Console for security purpose.
