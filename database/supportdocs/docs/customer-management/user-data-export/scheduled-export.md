**Step 4:** Select an export type, i.e. JSON or CSV.

**Step 5:** By default, all the fields are applicable for the selected export data. However, you can choose fields as per your requirements.

**Step 6:** Select the recurrence of the data export. For example, Daily, Weekly or Monthly and then the respective values like which day of the week or every X month.

**Step 7:** Add the email address of the recipient(s) who should receive the exported data link. You can add multiple email recipients.

**Step 8:** You can either enter the password or generate a random password. The password is required to view the export data. Thus, you must remember the entered/generated password.

**Step 9:** Click the **Request Export** button to create the request. The following displays the created scheduled export request:
