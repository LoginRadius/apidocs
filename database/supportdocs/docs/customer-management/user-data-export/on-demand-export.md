- Set the Encryption Key
  <br><br>_This will be the password you will need to enter in order to access the file. For security reasons, LoginRadius will not be able to provide you with this if forgotten, so be sure to remember what you have entered._

Once you have submitted your request, you and those you have input as recipients will receive the password-protected **.csv** or **.json** file.
