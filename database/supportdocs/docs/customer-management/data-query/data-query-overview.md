# Data Query Overview

The Data Query feature allows you to quickly filter your customer list, while the list of your customers is displayed in the LoginRadius Admin Console. This feature is similar to the [Customer Segmentation](/customer-management/customer-segmentation/customer-segmentation/), while the Customer Segmentation exports the data from the backend based on queries, Data Query allows you to run the query and view customers list on the application screen.

> **Note:** By default Data Query feature is disabled, If you want to enable this feature contact [LoginRadius support](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/support/tickets/open-a-new-ticket).

 
Thus, the Data Query gives you convenient and instant access to customers’ profiles that you can manage directly from the LoginRadius Admin Console. You can create data queries in the following two ways:

- **Customer Query**

- **Custom Object Query**

> **Note:** Note: Data Query sections display a maximum of 100 pages with 10 per customer profile listing on each page. To get up to 1 million customer data, you can use [**Customer Segmentation**](/customer-management/customer-segmentation/customer-segmentation/) or [**Data Export**](/customer-management/user-data-export/data-export-overview/) features.

## Customer Query

The Customer Query feature allows you to filter customers based on standard and/or custom fields. For instance, you can filter for a list of customers who are between the ages of 15 and 18, based in Vancouver, and using Facebook to login. You do this by specifying for the fields: Age, City, and Provider.

Learn more about Customer Query [here](/customer-management/data-query/customer-query/).

## Custom Object Query

The Custom Object Query feature gives you the ability to filter for customers based on fields contained under [Custom Objects](/governance/customer-profiling/custom-object-overview). An example of a custom object query would be filtering through customers’ purchase history for a particular item and filtering for a related item on their wishlist.
