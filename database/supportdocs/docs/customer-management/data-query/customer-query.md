# Customer Query

The **Customer Query** feature allows you to filter customers based on the profile fields and applying queries using the AND/OR logical operators. 

For example, you can filter for a list of customers who are between the ages of 20 and 45, based in Vancouver, and using Facebook to log in. You can do this by creating queries using the Age, City, and Provider fields.
