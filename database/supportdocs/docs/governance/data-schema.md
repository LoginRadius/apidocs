# Standard Login Form Fields

## Overview

This document highlights the fields provided by LoginRadius for user registration forms. We have categorized the fields in 3 categories i.e, Standard Fields (Basics), Standard Fields (Advanced) and Custom Fields. You can configure and manage the fields for registration forms under the LoginRadius Admin Console > Platform Configuration > Authentication Configuration > Standard Login > Data Schema.

> **Note:** There is no inherent limit for the fields in the profile. However, you can establish a limit by applying a regular expression (regex) to the required field. You can navigate to the [Platform Configuration > Standard Login > Data Schema](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/platform-configuration/authentication-configuration/standard-login/data-schema) section of the Admin Console to define the validation string according to your requirements.

### Custom Fields

Custom Fields are fields that you can create for your own specific needs and use on registration forms. They allow you to create new fields (up to 15) that are not listed under Standard Field (Basic and Advanced). If a field is not listed in the Standard Field list, you can create a new one, add it and configure it.

> **Note:** you should not create a field under custom field if it is already listed under standard fields list.
