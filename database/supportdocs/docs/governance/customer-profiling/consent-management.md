# Consent Management
-----


## Overview

Throughout the entirety of a customerâ€™s lifecycle, consent must be provided by the customer. With the imposition of stricter governance on user data from all parts of the world, businesses must be able to manage the information their customers have consented to release. To help with the constantly evolving rules surrounding information usage on the internet, and the growing need to obtain consent from your customers, Consent Management allows you to obtain consent from both your new and existing customers and to leverage that data as part of your workflows. The different consents prompted to your customers and their purposes are fully customizable. 

### Why is Consent Management important?

Consent Management is an important consideration for the authentication process when customers register or login to your site, whereby a process of consent is normally obtained and managed. If you make any changes to your site that require customer consent, then there must also be systems put in place to inform customers and provide methods in which they may easily opt-in/out.

Additionally, Consent Management helps your business adhere to strict regulations such as GDPR. GDPR outlines that the information taken from the customer must be explicit, unambiguous, well documented, freely given and easily withdrawn. With regulations on user data tightening up, it is important to have a tool to manage the customer data during and after registration. 

### What are the capabilities for Consent Management?

The Consent Management feature allows you to build custom consent forms. In addition, this feature makes it easy to modify existing consents prompted to your customers or apply new ones retroactively. Each consent you prompt can be enforced as either **Optional** or **Strict** depending on your workflow requirements.

**Optional:** It is optional for the customer to provide consent in order to access their profile.

**Strict:** It is mandatory for the customer to accept the configured consent in order to access their profile.

In all cases, the consent given by the customer will be stored directly onto their profile.  We also support the option to allow customers to revoke/unsubscribe from previously given consents, as per your requirements.
