# How do I configure social data settings?

You are provided with the basic data of customers who are registered using a social account. You can request additional data points by enabling **Extended Data** permission. Please see https://www.loginradius.com/datapoints/ for datapoints collected under Basic and Extended data permissions.

**Step 1.** Navigate to [Platform Configuration > Authentication Configuration > Social Login > Social Data Settings](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/platform-configuration/authentication-configuration/social-login/social-data-settings).

The following screen will appear, where the **Basic Data** option is enabled by default:
