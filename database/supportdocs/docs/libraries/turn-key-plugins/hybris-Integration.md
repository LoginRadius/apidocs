WebHooks allow you to build or set up integrations that subscribe to certain events on LoginRadius. When one of these events is triggered, LoginRadius will automatically send a POST payload over HTTPs to the WebHook's configured URL in real-time.

## Consent Management

LoginRadius Consent Management feature allows you to build custom consent forms. In addition, this feature makes it easy to modify existing consents prompted to your customers or apply new ones retroactively. Each consent you prompt can be enforced as either Optional or Strict depending on the workflow requirements. Consent Management helps your business adhere to strict regulations such as GDPR. GDPR outlines that the information taken from the customer must be explicit, unambiguous, well documented, freely given, and easily withdrawn.

## Field mapping

Below Hybris fields are mapped by default from LoginRadius to Hybris on registration, login, and profile update

* UID
* First Name

Apart from these 2 fields, you can map additional necessary fields for that you need to use the LoginRadius field mapping feature.

## Purchase Synchronization

After activating LoginRadius Commerce Cloud Extension, LoginRadius custom object should be enabled. Custom Object is a schema-less object that can be attached to a specific account. It can have a dynamic storage container that is updated with additional fields or data formats on the fly. A Custom Object should be used if you are looking to store large amounts of user data and the data can’t be formatted in a structured format because the data format could be different for each user.

An example of a Custom Object’s schema:

```
[
  {
    "Id": "5xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxf",
    "IsActive": true,
    "DateCreated": "2015-03-03T21:10:04.83Z",
    "DateModified": "2015-03-03T21:10:04.83Z",
    "IsDeleted": false,
    "Uid": "5xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxa",
    "CustomObject": {
      "Test":[
        {
          "field1": "Data3",
          "field2": "Data4",
          "field3": "Data5"
        },
        {
          "field11": "Data31",
          "field21": "Data41",
          "field31": "Data51"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```
