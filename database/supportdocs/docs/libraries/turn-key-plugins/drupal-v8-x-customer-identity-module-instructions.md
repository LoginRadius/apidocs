Follow the following instruction to upload PHP SDK manually.

1. Get the loginradius folder from given path and copy the folder
2. Go to your FTP.

3. Open the folder /vendor/.

4. Paste the loginradius folder into this directory.

5. Add the following path in file /vendor/composer/autoload_namespaces.php 'LoginRadiusSDK\\\\' => array(\$vendorDir . '/loginradius/php-sdk/src'),

6. If you have autoload_psr4.php file then please add the following path in this file /vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php:-
   'LoginRadiusSDK\\\\' => array(\$vendorDir . '/loginradius/php-sdk/src/LoginRadiusSDK'),

7. If you have autoload_static.php file then please follow the below step for drupal v8.x and v9.x respectively:

a) **For Drupal v8.x:** 
  <br><br>Add the following code in this file /vendor/composer/autoload_static.php

![](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/SDK_852362d77ff3243907.39343723.png "SDK")

### Through Composer

Please refer to the following steps to install the LoginRadius PHP SDK with Composer:

Note: If Composer is already installed then jump to Step 3.

**Step 1:** Download and enable Composer Manager module.

**Step 2:** Initialize Composer Manager

There are two ways of initializing Composer Manager.

Option A: Initialize Composer Manager using the init.php script

- Go to composer_manager/scripts directory
- Change the file permission of init.php with a command chmod 700 init.php

- Execute the init. script with a command ./init.php

Option B: Initialize Composer Manager using Drush

- If you are using Drush, you can initialize Composer Manager by drush composer-manager-init

- If you don't know how to use Drush, use option A

**Step 3:** Download LoginRadius PHP SDK with Composer

Now that we finally have Composer Manager initialized, we are ready to download the LoginRadius PHP SDK library with Composer.

1. Go to the root directory of your Drupal installation
2. Run the following command to install the standalone LoginRadius PHP SDK.

    `composer require loginradius/php-sdk:11.3.0`

>**Note:** If you want to update all required library then use the following command: composer drupal-update

Composer is now aware that the LoginRadius PHP SDK is required. It will first add this dependency to the **/core/composer.json** file which contains all external dependencies of your site. Then, it will automatically download the latest versions of the required libraries. You can verify the result by checking that LoginRadius PHP SDK is downloaded to **/vendor/loginradius/php-sdk** directory.

## Upgrading Existing Module

1. Login to Drupal Admin panel and go to Reports> Available updates.
2. Check the LoginRadius **Customer Identity and Access Management** under Modules list.

- Customer will need to register again.<br>

**If No is selected:** User will be deleted from Drupal only but still exists in LoginRadius Database, So in this case, if a deleted customer returns on the site:

- The customer will not be able to register again with the same email ID.

- The customer will still be able to log in, and a new profile will be created in Drupal and linked to the existing profile in the LoginRadius database.
