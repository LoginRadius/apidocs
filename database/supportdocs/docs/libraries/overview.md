Deployment Overview
===
---

This document covers various implementation methods that will help you in deployment of the **LoginRadius platform** in a quick time and easy way. It includes the deployment via all the well-known methods such as JavaScript libraries, web-based SDKs, Mobile SDKs, IDX and turn-key plugins, as well as, secure credentials for connecting these to the **LoginRadius SaaS platform**. 

####JS Libraries

LoginRadius provides a library of pre-written JavaScript functions which allows quick and easier implementation of features provided by **LoginRadius**. It is one of the most basic web-based implementation methodologies available with LoginRadius. There are many built-in options for customization available in this JavaScript library. For advanced development, it also includes **JavaScript hooks** and **JavaScript** form libraries. For more details, have a look [here](/api/v2/user-registration/user-registration-getting-started)

####Hosted Registration

It is a ready-to-use and easy-to-customize solution for all the necessary actions like Logins, registrations, etc with minimum knowledge. Also, the customization in this IDX implementation can be easily achieved using the [LoginRadius Admin Console](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com) with custom JS and CSS. For more details, have a look [here](/api/v2/deployment/identity-experience-framework/hosted/overview/).

####SDKs

Web-bases SDK libraries have been developed  for keeping the implementation at ease in commonly used web platforms like Java, Node.js, PHP, ASP.NET, Ruby and many more. The main advantage of using all of  these SDKs is their native approach for making API calls and handling their responses. All of these SDKs are open-source SDKs which allow you to build off and modify the code as per your unique requirements. For more details, have a look [here](/api/v2/sdk-libraries/sdk-libraries-overview)

####Mobile SDKs

Mobile SDKs too have a similar approach like the Web-based SDK but their use case and scope of implementation remains only to the mobile platforms. These mobile SDKs provide native implementations in mobile technologies like Android, iOS, Xamarin, PhoneGap, and Ionic. They're easy to use and offer similar advantages in mobile devices, as web SDK does for web applications. These are open-sourced SDKs and use technologies such as REST API and OAuth 2.0. For more details, have a look [here](/api/v2/mobile-libraries/mobile-sdk-overview).

####Turn-key Plugins

LoginRadius provides a variety of plugins that are built natively for CMS-based platforms like Drupal, Magento, WordPress, and many more. These are primarily used for quick integrations in consumer web applications for quick plug and play development. They allow you to get started within minutes with minimum programming skills.
