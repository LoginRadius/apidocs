Deployment Overview
===
---

This document covers various implementation methods to help you deploy the **LoginRadius platform** quickly and easily. It includes deployment via well-known methods such as JavaScript libraries, web-based SDKs, Mobile SDKs, IDX, Identity Orchestration, and turn-key plugins, as well as secure credentials for connecting these to the **LoginRadius SaaS platform**. 

### JS Libraries

LoginRadius provides a library of pre-written JavaScript functions that allow quick and easy implementation of features provided by **LoginRadius**. It is one of the most basic web-based implementation methodologies available with LoginRadius. There are many built-in customization options available in this JavaScript library. For advanced development, it also includes **JavaScript hooks** and **JavaScript** form libraries. For more details, have a look [here](/api/v2/user-registration/user-registration-getting-started)

### IDX Registration

It is a ready-to-use and easy-to-customize solution for all the necessary actions, such as Logins, Registrations, etc., with minimum knowledge. Also, customization in this IDX implementation can be easily achieved using the [LoginRadius Admin Console](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com) with custom JS and CSS. For more details, have a look [here](/api/v2/deployment/identity-experience-framework/hosted/overview/).

### SDKs

Web-based SDK libraries have been developed for keeping the implementation at ease in commonly used web platforms like Java, Node.js, PHP, ASP.NET, Ruby, and many more. The main advantage of using all of  these SDKs is their native approach for making API calls and handling their responses. All of these SDKs are open-source SDKs that allow you to build off and modify the code as per your unique requirements. For more details, have a look [here](/api/v2/sdk-libraries/sdk-libraries-overview)

### Mobile SDKs

Mobile SDKs, too, have a similar approach to the Web-based SDK, but their use case and scope of implementation remain only for mobile platforms. These mobile SDKs provide native implementations in mobile technologies like Android, iOS, Xamarin, PhoneGap, and Ionic. They're easy to use and offer similar advantages in mobile devices, as web SDK does for web applications. These open-sourced SDKs use technologies such as REST API and OAuth 2.0. For more details, have a look [here](/api/v2/mobile-libraries/mobile-sdk-overview).

### Turn-key Plugins

LoginRadius provides a variety of plugins that are built natively for CMS-based platforms like Drupal, Magento, WordPress, and many more. These are primarily used for quick integrations in consumer web applications for quick plug and play development. They allow you to get started within minutes with minimum programming skills. For more details, have a look [here](/api/v2/cms-turn-key-plugins/general-cms-integrations).


### Identity Orchestration

Identity Orchestration (IO) in LoginRadius empowers you to design and implement identity workflows tailored to specific needs, such as customer registration, authentication, and password recovery. With IO, you can create, test, and deploy workflows using pre-built templates or building them from scratch in the Workflow Builder. This flexibility allows for customized workflows across different brands or customer segments, enhancing the overall user experience. Additionally, IO provides efficient brand management capabilities.
Customization of this IO can be easily achieved using the LoginRadius [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/deployment/identity-orchestration/workflows). For more information, refer to the IO overview [documentation](/docs/libraries/identity-orchestration/overview/).
