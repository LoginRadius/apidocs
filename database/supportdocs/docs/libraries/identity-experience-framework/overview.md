# Identity Experience Framework

It is a set of registration, authentication, and related web pages such as forgot password, profile. It allows you to customize the UI and UX elements as per your requirements

It is hosted at LoginRadius, and you can perform all the actions on the Identity Experience Framework page without making any explicit configurations.
