# HTML Themed Demo

This document contains all of the details for our LoginRadius HTML themed demo. This demo is a simple website that allows different functionalities such as registration and login using the HTML method. This demo demonstrates the ease of implementation, getting a centralized look and feel, and customizability.

## How to Start

* Clone or Download our demo project from [here](https://github.com/LoginRadius/html5-sdk).
* Fill in your credentials under the config.js file located in the root of the project.
* Start your demo project with any web-server.
* We recommend http-server which is installable via `npm install http-server` (npm required)

```
var loginRadiusConfig = {};
loginRadiusConfig.apiKey = "<LoginRadius API Key>";
loginRadiusConfig.appName = "<LoginRadius Site Name>";
loginRadiusConfig.hashTemplate= true;
loginRadiusConfig.sott ="<Sott>";
loginRadiusConfig.verificationUrl = window.location;//Change as per requirement

var LRObject= new LoginRadiusV2(loginRadiusConfig);
```

**SOTT**:

* You can set a static SOTT from [here](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/api/v2/user-registration/sott#staticsott4).  
* If you want to setup a dynamically-generated SOTT, refer [here](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/api/v2/user-registration/sott)
