# LoginRadius Google Assistant Demo

**Google Assistant** is an artificial intelligence-powered virtual assistant developed by Google that is primarily available on mobile and smart home devices. Unlike the company's previous virtual assistant, Google now, the Google Assistant can engage in two-way conversations.

Actions on Google is the official collection of tools, documentation, and APIs for development on the Google assistant service. This document takes you through the process of configuring our Google Assistant Demo that goes over the account linking process.


> **Prerequisites:**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) needs to be installed on your system. 
- [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) needs to be installed in your system.

## Deploying and Executing the Demo

1. Clone the github repo for the demo.
2. Configure the file **index.js** to match your API Key.
3. In your terminal:
   - Run the command `cd` to directory
   - Run the command `npm install`
4. Install node.js and run node index.js` through command line to start your server.
5. In your LoginRadius Admin Console, [whitelist](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/api/v2/admin-console/dev-stagin-sandbox-environment) your server's secure URL: `https://oauth-redirect.googleusercontent.com`
6. Under **Build > Action** go to Dialogflow Admin Console and click **Fulfillment** on the left side menu, and enable the **Webhook** option, enter the secure URL to your server and click on **Save** button.

## Testing

Now that everything is in place, you can either test using the [Actions Simulator](https://developers.google.com/actions/tools/simulator) by clicking "TEST" or via a Google Home device. If you use the Google Simulator and would like to test Account Linking, the simulator will not be able to return the login URL to your phone's Google Home app, instead, you will need to go the Simulator's DEBUG section on the right, and you should be able to find the link under 'debugInfo'.
