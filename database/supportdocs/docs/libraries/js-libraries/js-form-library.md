# JS Form Library

---

The **LoginRadiusV2.js** is commonly used to automatically generate HTML interfaces required for customer identity management e.g. Login form, Registration form, One-Time Passcode (OTP), Forgot Password, and Email Verification. The JS Form library is a library that is built in the **LoginRadiusV2.js** and is used for cases where you are required to build your own forms and functionality as opposed to using the automatically generated forms/interfaces.

This document describes the different function calls that can be made to the various LoginRadius APIs via the JS Form Library, allowing you to easily add support for LoginRadius to your custom built forms.

> **Note:** If you are currently using the automatically generated interfaces provided by **LoginRadiusV2.js** and are looking to add additional customizations/functionality, we recommend using the [JavaScript Hooks](/api/v2/user-registration/javascript-hooks) or our [LoginRadius HTML5 SDK](/api/v2/sdk-libraries/html5-js).

## Initialization

First you will need to make sure that LoginRadiusV2.js is loaded on your page:

`https://auth.lrcontent.com/v2/js/LoginRadiusV2.js`

Next, you will need to initialize the APIs with your LoginRadius API key.

```
var commonOptions = {};
commonOptions.apiKey = "<LoginRadius API Key>";
var LRObject = new LoginRadiusV2(commonOptions);
LRObject.api.init(commonOptions);
```

## Login

To implement a login, you will need to call the **LRObject.api.login** function which is used to handle a traditional email + password login.

Format:

`LRObject.api.login(data, onLoginSuccess, onLoginError);`

- **data**: Data is an object that represents the data required for login. For details on what information you can provide [click here](/api/v2/user-registration/post-auth-login-by-email). Typically it should have the properties **emailid** for the provided email and **password** for the provided password.

- **onSuccess**: Pass in a function you would like to use as a callback for a successful login.

- **onError**: Pass in a function you would like to use as a callback for a failed login attempt.

Example:

```
LRObject.api.login({
            emailid: "example@example.com",
            password: "123xxx789"
        },
        function(response) {
        // On Success this callback will call
        // response will be { access_token :"<token>", expires_in :"<date and time>" }
        // you can use token response.access_token and get user profile using your
        // LoginRadius SDK.
            alert(JSON.stringify(response));
        }, function(errors) {
        // on failure this function will call ‘errors’ which is an array of errors with message.
        // every kind of error will be returned in this method
        // you can run a loop on this array to identify the description and other aspect of error.
            alert(JSON.stringify(errors));
        });
```

**NOTE:** This function also supports phone login **commonOptions.phoneLogin** should be set to true to enable Phone Login.

## Registration

The registration Function is used to register new users.

Format:

`LRObject.api.registration(schema, data, onRegistrationSuccess, onRegistrationError);`

- **schema**: The schema for the fields being provided. You can leave schema as an empty array unless you're updating complex arrays.

- **data**: Data is an object that represents the user profile that you are creating, you can refer to our [detailed datapoints](/api/v2/user-registration/detailed-data-point) doc for more information on which fields can be updated. Using this API you cannot specify complex array fields directly within this object without using the schema.

- **onSuccess**: Pass in a function you would like to use as a callback for a successful registration.

- **onError**: Pass in a function you would like to use as a callback for a failed registration attempt.

Example:

```
var schema = [{
        type: "string",
        name: "email",
        display: "Email Id",
        rules: "required|valid_email",
        permission: "r"
    }, {
        type: "password",
        name: "password",
        display: "Password",
        rules: "required|min_length[6]|max_length[32]",
        permission: "w"
    }];

var data =  {
      email: [{type: "Primary", value: "example@example23423423.com"}],
      password: "Testing123"
  };

LRObject.api.registration(schema, data,
  function(response) {
        alert(JSON.stringify(response));
    },
  function(errors) {
        alert(JSON.stringify(errors));
    });
```

## Update

Account updates can be accomplished via the **LRObject.api.updateData** function.

Format:

`LRObject.api.updateData(schema, data, token, onUpdateSuccess, onUpdateError);`

- **schema**: The schema for the fields being provided. You can leave schema as an empty array unless you're updating complex arrays.

- **data**: Data is an object that represents the fields and their values of the profile that you are updating. You can refer to our [detailed datapoints](/api/v2/user-registration/detailed-data-point) doc for more information on which fields can be updated. Please note that when using this library you cannot specify complex array fields.

- **token**: The access_token of the customer.

- **onSuccess**: Pass in a function you would like to use as a callback for a successful update.

- **onError**: Pass in a function you would like to use as a callback for an unsuccessful update.

## Forgot Password

**LRObject.api.forgotPassword** is used to send a forgot password email to a customer, the email will contain the verification token to then be consumed the resetPassword function.

> **Note**: Since the **Forgot Password** flow requires a **resetpasswordurl** on which the user will be redirected to reset the password, it is required to whitelist that resetpasswordurl. To whitelist the same, navigate to LoginRadius [Admin console > Deployment > Apps > Web Apps](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/deployment/apps/web-apps), and add the URL under the Production Website URL(s) section.

Format:

`LRObject.api.forgotPassword(data,onSuccess, onError);`

- **data**: Data is an object that contains the object details for the [Auth Forgot Password API](/api/v2/user-registration/auth-forgot-password), this object requires the **email** of the customer.

- **onSuccess**: Pass in a function you would like to use as a callback when the email was successfully sent.

- **onError**: Pass in a function you would like to use as a callback for when attempting to send the email has failed.

Example:

```
LRObject.api.forgotPassword({
    email: "xxx@xxx.com"
}, function(response) {
    alert(JSON.stringify(response));
}, function(errors) {
    alert(JSON.stringify(errors));
});
```

## Reset Password

To reset a password you can call **LRObject.api.resetPassword** along with the new password, the password should be passed inside the data object.

Format:

`LRObject.api.resetPassword(data, onSuccess, onError);`

- **data**: Data is an object that represents the body params for the [Auth Reset Password API](/api/v2/user-registration/auth-reset-password-by-reset-token) it requires the following:

  - **resettoken**: The password reset token the customer should have received via email when requesting a password reset.
  - **password**: the new desired password.
  - **confirmpassword**: The new desired password (again).

- **onSuccess**: Pass in a function you would like to use as a callback for a successful password change.

- **onError**: Pass in a function you would like to use as a callback for a failed password change attempt.

Example:

LRObject.api.resetPassword({
     resettoken: "5f0fc908xxxxxxxxxx800d2468a93d73",
     confirmpassword: "123xxx789",
     password: "123xxx789"
 }, function(response) {
     alert(JSON.stringify(response));
 }, function(errors) {
     alert(JSON.stringify(errors));
 });
```

## Email Verification

To implement email verification, you will need to setup an email verification page on your website and call **LRObject.api.emailVerification** along with the verification token (also known as vtoken).

The verification page that has this emailVerification function should be the same that you have provided in your LoginRadiusV2.js options object "commonOptions.verificationUrl".

Alternatively, in the LoginRadius Admin Console in your verification email template, you can also hard code the link to your verification page that has the emailVerification function.

For more details on email verification, we recommend reading our documentation on [Email Workflow Settings](/api/v2/admin-console/email-workflow/email-workflow-settings) and on [Email Template Management](/api/v2/admin-console/email-workflow/email-template-management)

Note: This function leverages the [Auth Verify Email API](/api/v2/customer-identity-api/authentication/auth-verify-email). Review this API if you need details on parameters that can be provided in the **Data** object.

Format:

`LRObject.api.emailVerification(data,onSuccess, onError);`

        alert(JSON.stringify(errors));
    });

```

## Social Login Function

To implement Social Login, call the **LRObject.api.socialLogin** function along with the token, in this case, the token comes from the callback response after the social login process. This will also prompt a 'missing required field' filling interface if some fields are not filled automatically from the data obtained via the social provider. By filling in the form, the customer's account will be generated.

`LRObject.api.socialLogin (data, onSuccess, onError, onMissingField, Schema)`

- **data**: Pass in an object that contains a **token** that has the access_token for the value.

- **onSuccess**: Pass in a function you would like to use as a callback for a successful social login.
