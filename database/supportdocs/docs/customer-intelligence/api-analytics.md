# API Analytics 

In this section, we have covered the **API Statistics** available in the **Insight** tab under the [**Admin Console**](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/insights/api-analytics/request-count) which represents the analytics report for requests made to various types of CRUD APIs. This contains useful charts and analytic tools to view and measure the overall performance of your site in terms of the number of API requests made and search history is now available for up to 30 days. 

The information is aggregated and categorized into Request Count, Response Code, and Performance analysis. This analytics will be helpful to improve the overall application performance and understand the customer experience.
 
>**Note:** This feature is an add-on and needs to be enabled by LoginRadius, please contact [LoginRadius Support](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/support/tickets/open-a-new-ticket) for details.
