## Monthly Active Customers

The Monthly Active Customers chart displays the number of Unique Customer Profiles that have logged in to your site per month. For clarification on how this works, please see below:

* If I login ten times with Facebook over the course of one month, this will be counted as one Unique Profile Login for that month.

* If I login ten times with Facebook and ten times with LinkedIn over the course of one month, this will be counted as two Unique Profile Logins for that month.

## User Return Rate by Provider

The User Return Rate by Provider chart displays the average number of times a Unique User Profile has logged in with a specific provider over a given time.

For example, let’s say that over the last thirty days, your site had one hundred Facebook User Profiles registered. Over this thirty day period, fifty out of these hundred User Profiles logged in ten times each and the remaining fifty User Profiles logged in five times each. In this situation, the Facebook User Return Rate for the past thirty days would be 7.5, meaning that on average, a Facebook User Profile logged in 7.5 times over the last thirty day period.
