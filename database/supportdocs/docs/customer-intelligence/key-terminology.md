# Key Terminology

## Active Customers

**"Active Customers"** refers to the customers who have logged in to their accounts over the selected period of time.

* For example: The Admin Console overview shows 100 active customers within the last 7 days. This means that 100 customers have logged in to their account on your website within the last 7 days.

## Logins

**"Logins"** refers to the total number of logins over the given time range or demographic being analyzed.

## Provider vs. Social Provider

**"Provider"** refers to any given method you have configured for your site’s login and registration service. If you are using both traditional Email and password registration, as well as social login, and have configured Facebook and Twitter, for example, you will have three Providers; Email, Facebook, and Twitter.

**"Social Provider"** refers to any provider that has been configured for your site’s social login service. With the example above, Facebook and Twitter are both Social Providers, while Email is not.

## Unique Profile Logins

**"Unique Profile Logins"** refers to the number of logins by unique Customer Profiles over the given time range and/or demographic being analyzed.

## Customer Profiles

**"Customer Profiles"** refers to profiles attached to a Customer Account. If a Customer logs in into your site using LinkedIn, then Facebook, and then creates a traditional Email and password account, this Customer will have three associated Customer Profiles.

## Customer Accounts

**"Customer Accounts"** are associated with one Email address and LoginRadius User ID (UID). Several Customer Profiles can be tied to one Customer Account.

* For Example: Mary has registered with your LoginRadius site by creating a traditional Email and password account using mary@example.com. Later, she logs in with LinkedIn and Facebook, and both of these social accounts are associated with mary@example.com. Now, Mary has one Customer Account (identifiable by mary@example.com or a her LoginRadius UID) and three profiles (Email, LinkedIn and Facebook).
