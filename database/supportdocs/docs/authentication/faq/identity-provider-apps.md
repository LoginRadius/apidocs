#Identity Provider Apps

##What is an Identity Provider App?

An "Identity Provider App" essentially allows you to access a website or mobile application using your credentials for another application. Social log in providers (like Facebook or Google) can be used as an example of how these work, as they allow end-users to access a website or mobile app using their social identities.

In addition to social log in, LoginRadius offers the ability to set up custom Identity Providers, which will allow your users to access your site or app using their credentials for third-party systems aside from the social providers that LoginRadius already supports.

##Why is it Useful?

Identity provider apps are useful because they allow an extra layer of customization to the log in and registration flow. There are several different protocols supported by LoginRadius, which means that the connection and flow of information between the two systems can also be entirely customized.


####Example Use Case

So, as mentioned, Identity Provider Apps allow end-users to access your site or app using credentials for another third-party system.

Let's say that there is a province-wide application system for post-secondary schools. Many of the students who will be applying for colleges through this platform will be coming from a high school in the province, so they will have a profile with the provincial high school system. Instead of only offering email and password registration, the college application platform could place a button on their registration interface that allows them to log in via the high school application system. This will accomplish two things; 1) it will save the user from having to create another account with a new set of credentials, 2) it will allow the user's profile to be transferred over to the new system (as opposed to being created from scratch), for continuity as well as less of a time required for users.
