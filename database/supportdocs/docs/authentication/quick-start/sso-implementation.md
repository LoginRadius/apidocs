# Single Sign-On Introduction

**Single Sign-on (SSO)** refers to the authentication process that allows your customers to access multiple applications with a single set of login credentials and an active login session. 

For example, if you log in to Gmail, you are automatically logged into other Google services like YouTube, Google Analytics, etc. Similarly, if you log out of Gmail, you are automatically logged out of all other Google services.
LoginRadius Identity Platform supports the following SSO methods:

- [Web SSO](/single-sign-on/tutorial/web-sso/overview/)
- [Mobile SSO](/single-sign-on/tutorial/mobile-sso/overview/)
- [Federated SSO](/single-sign-on/tutorial/federated-sso/overview/)


> **Note:** Refer to [Web SSO guide](/single-sign-on/tutorial/web-sso/overview/) to implement the single sign-on for your applications. The Web SSO can be implemented among multiple web applications. However, this guide focuses on the Web SSO implementation between two web applications.
