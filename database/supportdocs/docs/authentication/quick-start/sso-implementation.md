# Single Sign-On Introduction

**Single Sign-on (SSO**) refers to an authentication process where users log into one application and are automatically logged into other applications, regardless of the technology, platform, or domain they are using. 

For instance, logging into Gmail also logs you into other Google services like YouTube and Google Analytics. Conversely, logging out of Gmail will log you out of all other Google services as well.
The LoginRadius Identity Platform supports several SSO methods:

- [Web SSO](/single-sign-on/tutorial/web-sso/overview/)
- [Mobile SSO](/single-sign-on/tutorial/mobile-sso/overview/)
- [Federated SSO](/single-sign-on/tutorial/federated-sso/overview/)

> **Note:** Refer to the [Web SSO guide](/single-sign-on/tutorial/web-sso/overview/) for implementing single sign-on for your applications. Web SSO can be implemented across multiple web applications; however, this guide specifically focuses on implementing Web SSO between two web applications.
