# Social Login Introduction

Social Login is a quick and convenient approach for registration and login, as it allows your customers to skip filling registration forms. It also increases customer conversion rates, by enabling them to sign-in to your website with their existing social media accounts like Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and more.

## Social Login Guide

This guide will take you through the process to set up and implement a social login flow. It covers everything you need to configure and deploy the social login feature using LoginRadius Identity Platform.

> **Pre-requisites**

> - A social provider account that you want to implement on your website.

> - Basic knowledge of HTML/JavaScript.

An updated chart of all data points based on providers can be found [here](http://www.loginradius.com/datapoints).

## Part 1 - Configuration

This section covers the required configurations that you need to perform in the LoginRadius Admin Console to implement the Social Login functionality.

### Configure Social Provider

**Step 1:** Login to your <a href = https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/ target=_blank>**Admin Console**</a> account and navigate to <a href = https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/platform-configuration/authentication-configuration/social-login/social-providers target=_blank>**Platform Configuration > Authentication Configuration > Social Login > Social providers**</a>.

The following screen will appear:

> **Note:** You can skip **Step 4**, in case of implementing the Social Login using the Identity Experience Framework (IDX).

**Step 4:** Whitelist your application domain as explained below:

- In LoginRadius Admin Console, navigate to <a href = https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/deployment/apps/web-apps target=_blank>**Deployment > Apps**</a> and the following screen will appear:

  ![Web Apps](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/SSO-config2_159475e7375b633df52.56748253.png "Web Apps")

- Click the **Add New Site** button, the following section will appear:

  ![Add New Site](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/SSO-config2-1_275775e73766f216832.03208176.png "Add New Site")

- Enter your application domain URL in the textbox and click the **Add** button.

### Configure Social Data Points

You are provided with the basic data of customers who registered using a social account. The respective social provider shares the basic data as a default. To avail the additional data of such customers you are required to:

1. Enable the desired additional permission for your social app.
2. Enable the Extended Data option in the LoginRadius Admin Console.

The following explains how you can set the Extended Data option in the LoginRadius Admin Console:

**Step 1.** Navigate to [Platform Configuration > Authentication Configuration > Social Login > Social Data Settings](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/platform-configuration/authentication-configuration/social-login/social-data-settings).

The following screen will appear, where the **Basic Data** option is enabled by default:

![Social Data Settings - Basic Data](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/Social-Data-Settings---Basic-Data_59196281ba7363fa34.97161201.png "Social Data Settings - Basic Data")

**Step 2.** Click the **Extended Data** switch to enable extended data points.

> **Note:** Accessing data points beyond Basic Data may require additional steps with your selected social provider(s).

## Part 2 - Deployment

The LoginRadius Identity Platform supports a variety of implementation methodologies that allow you to customize customer flows. This guide focuses on the basic Identity Experience Framework implementation but it can be accomplished with any of the other implementation methodologies supported by LoginRadius.

Full details on these methodologies can be found [here](/api/v2/getting-started/implementation-workflows/).

**Step 1:** Locate the **Auth Page URL** as explained below:

Navigate to <a href = https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/deployment/idx target=_blank>**Deployment > Identity Experience Framework (Hosted)**</a> and the following screen will appear:

![Auth Page URL](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/1_302836204086435b412.59992184.png "Auth Page URL")

The **Auth Page URL** displays your unique IDX domain in the following format:

```
<https://<sitename>.hub.loginradius.com/auth.aspx>
```

In the above URL, [sitename](/api/v2/admin-console/deployment/get-site-app-name/) is the name of your LoginRadius Site.

You can directly navigate to this domain to review your configured interfaces from [Part 1](#partconfiguration1).

**Step 2:** Embed Authentication Pages in your Website as explained below:

Add a link on your webpage for redirecting customers to the Identity Experience Framework(Hosted) Page.

```
<a href="https://<LoginRadius Site Name>.hub.loginradius.com/auth.aspx?action=<Desired Action>&return_url=<Return URL>">Register</a>
```

In the above URL replace the following:

1. **LoginRadius Site Name** : Your unique LoginRadius [sitename](/api/v2/admin-console/deployment/get-site-app-name/).

2. **Desired Action** : Following are the action list you can use.
   <br><br> Login
   <br> Register
   <br> Logout

**Examples:**

**Login Page**

```
<a href="https://<LoginRadius Site Name>.hub.loginradius.com/auth.aspx?action=login&return_url=<Return URL>">Login</a>
```

**Registration Page**

```
 <a href="https://<LoginRadius Site Name>.hub.loginradius.com/auth.aspx?action=register&return_url=<Return URL>">Register</a>
```

<br> **3. Return URL** : The URL you would like to redirect customers after completing the selected action.

Try this link out on your page, you should be redirected over to the LoginRadius Hosted Page where you can register and login.

> **Note:** Use the following URL link to display the profile page of logged in customers.

```
 <a href="https://<LoginRadius site name>.hub.loginradius.com/profile.aspx">View Profile</a>
```

> **Note:** We have additional language specific examples [here](/api/v2/deployment/identity-experience-framework/hosted/usage/#tokenhandling1) if you want to capture this token in other programming languages.

**Step 3:** Store the captured Access Token as explained below:

Once a customer has completed the login action the IDX page will redirect the customer back to the specified return URL and include an access token as a query parameter in the URL.

```
<Redirect URL>?token=<Access Token>
```

To get the access token, please add this JavaScript snippet in your web page

```
function getParameterByName(name) {
                name = name.replace(/[\[]/, '\\[').replace(/[\]]/, '\\]');
                var regex = new RegExp('[\\?&]' + name + '=([^&#]*)');
                var results = regex.exec(location.search);
                return results === null ? '' : decodeURIComponent(results[1].replace(/\+/g, ' '));
            }
var access_token = getParameterByName(“token”);
```

If you have already added the **getParameterByName** function, call this function to get the access token in the access_token variable.

You can store the obtained access token in your cookie, local storage and more as per the use case. The following are the example codes for storing the access token in a cookie and local storage:

**Storing in cookie:**

```
function setCookie(cname, cvalue, exdays) {
  var d = new Date();
  d.setTime(d.getTime() + (exdays * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
  var expires = "expires="+d.toUTCString();
  document.cookie = cname + "=" + cvalue + ";" + expires + ";path=/";
}
```

Here **cname** is cookie name, **cvalue** is access_token and **exdays** is the expiry date of cookie where you need to pass the number of days.

```
setCookie(“lr-session-token”, access_token, “No days”)
```

**Storing in local storage:**

```
localStorage.setItem("lr-session-token", access_token);// First parameter will be the local storage name and 2nd parameter will be access_token
```

**Step 4:** You can use the Access Token as explained below:

Call the [LoginRadius API](/api/v2/customer-identity-api/authentication/auth-read-profiles-by-token/) to retrieve the customer profile using the Access Token. Alternatively, you can leverage any of our SDKs to accomplish this.

The following is the script example to retrieve the customer profile:

```
<script>
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
url = "https://api.loginradius.com/identity/v2/auth/account?apiKey=xxxxxx&access_token="+access_token
xhr.open("GET", url);
xhr.setRequestHeader('X-Requested-With', 'XMLHttpRequest');
xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
xhr.send();
 xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
      console.log(xhr.response);
    }
  }
</script>
```

> **Note:** Once a consumer logs in through a configured social provider, account linking is handled at LoginRadius end, for more details around Account Linking you can refer to this [document](/authentication/faq/account-linking/).

&nbsp;

> **Additional Note**: We also provide a feature under which you can create multiple instances of same social provider on your Login/Registration page. Check out the relevant document in the next steps.
