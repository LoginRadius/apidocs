# Passkey Authentication Configuration

## Introduction

Passkey Authentication is a modern, passwordless authentication method that enhances user security and convenience. Using passkeys, users can authenticate themselves without traditional passwords, reducing the risk of password-related security breaches. This document provides a detailed overview of the passkey functionality and **step-by-step instructions** on **configuring this feature** in the LoginRadius Admin Console.

## Configuration Steps

- Navigate to [Platform Configuration > Advance Login Methods > Passkey Authentication](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/platform-configuration/authentication-configuration/advance-login-methods/passkey-authentication).

- Enable the **Passkey Authentication** toggle.

    Configure the following settings as needed:

    > **Passkey Selection:** Choose between Autofill, Button, or Both. Autofill allows users to select the passkey from the autofill form, Button displays a "Sign In with Passkey" button on the login page, and Both enable both options.

- **Progressive Enrollment:** Enable this option to prompt users to establish a passkey during email/password login if needed. Users can skip this step, and it will reappear after a specified delay.

    > **Progressive Enrollment Delay (Days):** Specify the number of days after which the progressive enrollment option will reappear for users who skip it.

- **Local Enrollment:** Enable this to require users to generate a local passkey when logging in on a new device using a cross-device passkey. Users can skip this step if needed.

    > **Relying Party Display Name:** Enter the brand name of the relying party (website).
    > 
   >  **Relying Party ID:** Enter the base domain name without schema or ports.
    > 
    > **Relying Party Origins:** Enter the exact domain name with schema and port, if applicable.
    Example: https://<LoginRadius site name>.hub.loginradius.com

- Click **SAVE** to apply the configurations.
