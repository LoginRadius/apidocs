# Customer Data Management Introduction

LoginRadius Identity Platform allows you to organize and manage your customer data in the following ways:

- **Customer Management:** You can add new customers and manage your existing customers using the LoginRadius Admin Console. This feature gives your customer service team the ability to manage requests from the customers. For more details, refer to this [document](/customer-management/overview/). 

 Alternatively, you use [Account Management APIs](/api/v2/customer-identity-api/account/account-overview/#data-export) to manage the customers. To get the list of existing customers, you can use the [Cloud Identity APIs](/api/v2/cloud-directory-api/identity/getting-started/#data-export). 


- **Customer Data Export:** You can export data of your customersâ€™ profile, based on the business requirements. For example, you can use this feature to retrieve customers in a given timeframe. There is an option to configure the export schedules to get the customer data periodically, or you can export customer's data when required. You can export customer data in CSV or JSON format. For more details, refer to this [document](/customer-management/user-data-export/data-export-overview/).

- **Customer Segmentation:** You can set up and save custom filters to retrieve a list of the respective customers. You can download these lists in CSV and JSON format. For more details, refer to this [document](/customer-management/customer-segmentation/customer-segmentation/).

- **Customer Data Query:** You can filter and view the customer data. The filter options for Data Query is the same as available in the Customer Segmentation. However, the data query section does not allow you to export the data. Hence, you can use this option when a quick view of specific customer data is required. For more details, refer to this [document](/customer-management/data-query/data-query-overview/).

- **Customer Profile Editor:** You can make all the registration form fields editable for your customers except **Password** and **Confirm Password** fields using the LoginRadius Admin Console. This feature gives your customer a way to update their profile anytime they want. For more details, refer to this [document](/authentication/concepts/profile-editor/).
