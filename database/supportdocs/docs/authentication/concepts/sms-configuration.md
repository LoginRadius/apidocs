# SMS Provider Introduction

An **SMS Provider** enables a system to send and receive text messages to and from an SMS capable device over the global telecommunication network. The SMS Gateway translates the message and makes it compatible for delivery over the network so that it can reach to the recipient.

LoginRadius Identity Platform establishes SMS communication by sending the SMS from your SMS provider to your customers. To send out SMS from your SMS provider, you will need to configure the SMS provider settings.

The following is a sequence diagram for sending an event-based SMS using the LoginRadius Identity Platform:

The following steps explain the working of SMS communication in the LoginRadius Identity Platform: 



1. The customer initiates a login request in the application via LoginRadius' API.
3. LoginRadius retrieves the message content and generates the [OTP code](https://www.loginradius.com/docs/infrastructure-and-security/loginradius-tokens#phone-otp-one-time-password-). LoginRadius then makes a call to your desired SMS Service Provider with the message content and generates the OTP code to form the SMS message.

5. On success, the SMS provider returns a response to LoginRadius, which is then relayed to the initiating application. The SMS message containing the message content and OTP code is sent by the SMS Service Provider back to the customer.
 
7. The customer enters the OTP code via LoginRadius' API.

9. The OTP code is authorized by LoginRadius and subsequently returns a success response to the application.


## SMS Provider Configuration

This section will take you through the configuration of the SMS provider in your LoginRadius Admin Console. Here you will get detailed information about the SMS provider used for sending the SMS to the customer.
