# Customer Data Export

The **Data Export** feature allows you to retrieve customers’ data in CSV or JSON formats. You can export data in the following two ways:

- [On-Demand Export](#partondemandexport0)
- [Scheduled Export](#partscheduledexport1)

> **Notes:**
>
> - LoginRadius Identity Platform uses the UTC time standard for all data export requests.
> - You can export a maximum of 1 million records in a single export request.
> - CSV export is limited to a specific number of fields but if you are looking to export the complete profile with all fields, please go with the JSON export.

In addition, you can view the logs of export data requests, as explained in the [Export Logs](#partexportlogs2) section.
