# About LoginRadius Tokens#

There are several tokens that are generated through the whole authentication process with LoginRadius. As it can be easy to get them confused, this guide provides information about each of the tokens below:

- [LoginRadius Request Token](#loginradiusrequesttokenexpirationmins0)
- [LoginRadius Access Token](#loginradiusaccesstokenexpirationmins1)
- [Social Platform Token](#socialplatformtokenexpirationvariesbynetwork2)
- [Verification Token](#verificationtoken3)
- [LoginRadius Password Token](#loginradiuspasswordtokenexpirationhours4)
- [SOTT (Secured One Time Token)](#sottsecuredonetimetoken5)
- [Phone OTP (One Time Password)](#phoneotponetimepassword6)
- [Google Authenticator OTP](#googleauthenticatorotponetimepassword7)
- [JWT (JSON Web Token)](#jwtjsonwebtoken8)

## LoginRadius Request Token (Expiration: 15 mins)

This token is returned by a successful login request for a social ID provider such as Facebook and is stored in the global REQUEST variable and returned to the callback page you defined. Generally, this token is retrieved from the REQUEST variable and is used to call the LoginRadius Access Token API to get the LoginRadius access token.

Note: If you are using our LoginRadius V2 API JavaScript Interface (LoginRadiusV2.js) this flow is handled automatically,
upon doing a log-in the user is automatically given a LoginRadius Access Token.

## LoginRadius Access Token (Expiration: 15 mins)

>**NOTE:** If you would like to have your LoginRadius Access Token extended to longer than 90 days please contact <a href = https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/support/tickets/open-a-new-ticket target=_blank> LoginRadius Support Team</a>.

This token is returned by a call to the LoginRadius Access Token API and is generated from your LoginRadius Request Token (see above). It is combined with your LoginRadius API key forming a unique identifier that informs LoginRadius who the user is and which social platform they are currently associated with, in order to retrieve the correct information. The LoginRadius access token is required for almost all LoginRadius Social API calls and many of the Authentication API calls.

As part of our SSO (Single-Sign-On) workflows, the LoginRadius Radius Token is also leveraged by the SSO scripts to see if a session is ongoing. You can read more about this in our [Single-Sign-On Documentation](/api/v2/single-sign-on/getting-started#customvalidationmessagehook11).

**Additional Information**:

1. The LoginRadius Access Token is referred to as "access_token" when it needs to be passed as a parameter in our API Documentation.

E.g. [Auth Read all Profiles by Token](/api/v2/user-registration/auth-readall-profiles-by-token)

2. When using LoginRadiusV2.js, upon a successful Login the Access Token is stored by default in the browser's localstorage and sessionstorage as LRTokenKey and in the cookies as lr-session-token

## Social Platform Token (Expiration: Varies by Network)

The expiration time for the most popular social ID providers can be found [here](/development/social-network/social-provider-faqs#what-is-the-token-lifetime-for-facebook-google-twitter-and-linkedin-).

This token is generated by the social ID provider (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, etc.) associated with the user and is used by the provider to identify the user. With this token, you can call the various APIs from that social ID provider. This token can be retrieved by calling the LoginRadius User Profile API with extended user profile data permission.

## Verification Token

The Verification Token, also known as "vtoken" is used every time a workflow requires a user to do a Verification by email. There are different types of Verification tokens depending on the workflow used called "vtype".

In a standard workflow, the user receives an email prompting them to verify via a URL, the URL includes the Verification Token as a query parameter named "vtoken" and another query parameter "vtype" is used to indicate the type of workflow.

If the LoginRadius JavaScript Interface is configured on the page provided in the URL, it will consume the vtoken and verify the user for the intended workflow. Otherwise, the vtoken can be consumed via one of our APIs.

To customize how the "vtoken" is displayed in an email please see our Email Template documentation [here](/api/v2/dashboard/email-workflow/email-template-management).

Please see below for the different types of Verification Tokens:

| vtype             | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | default expiration      |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| emailverification | This token is used as part of a User Registration workflow to verify the user. It will be returned in the LoginRadius Email Verification template and can be consumed by the LoginRadius JS Interface to both verify and login the user. If the initial email is lost or the Token expires the email will be resent upon the user's next attempt to log in.                                                       | 4320 Minutes / 72 hours |
| reset             | This token is used as part of a Password Reset / Forgot Password workflow, it is returned in the LoginRadius Forgot Password template. It can be used by the LoginRadius JS Interface to identify whether the Reset Password interface should be displayed and is included in the Reset Password request to verify that the request is valid. The email can be re-sent by initiating the forgot password process. | 4320 Minutes / 72 hours |
| deleteuser        | This token is used as part of the Delete request workflow where a user requesting to delete their account needs to confirm by clicking the provided URL in the Delete Account Email template.

## LoginRadius Password Token (Expiration: 24 hours)

### SOTT (Secured One Time Token)

The SOTT is a token used to identify a browser session during registration, which can be used as an alternative to reCaptcha to prevent abuse.
You can read more about the SOTT in our [SOTT documentation](/api/v2/user-registration/sott)

### Phone OTP (One Time Password)

The Phone One Time Password is a password that is texted to a user to be used once for the purpose of Login.
Once the token is consumed it expires and a new one will be required to Login next time.

### Google Authenticator OTP (One Time Password)

The Google Authenticator OTP is used strictly in the context of Multi-Factor Authentication. The end-user attempts to login using a username and password and is then prompted to enter the Google OTP. This is obtained by the user by opening the Google Authenticator app on their phone and typing the OTP in the browser to complete the login process.

You can learn more about this flow in our [Google Authenticator Workflow documentation](/api/v2/user-registration/two-factor-authentication-overview#googleauthenticatorworkflow1).

## JWT (JSON Web Token)

JWT is a popular method for establishing SSO (Single-Sign-On) connections between business apps. LoginRadius supports the handling of JSON Web Tokens.
Please see our documentation on JWT for more details [here](/api/v2/single-sign-on/jwt-login).

> **Note:** The default JWT token expiration time is 10 min, If you would like to have your JWT Token extended to longer than 10 minutes please contact <a href = https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/support/tickets/open-a-new-ticket target=_blank> LoginRadius Support Team</a>.
