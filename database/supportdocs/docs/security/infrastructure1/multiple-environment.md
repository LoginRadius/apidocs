This document highlights the supported environment by LoginRadius where you can utilize LoginRadius features with your respective domains. We support both production and development environments. To set up the implementation with the respective environments you need to whitelist all your domains (staging/production) under the LoginRadius Admin Console.

## Production Environment

The production environment is the environment where your services are made available to your customers. It's an instance (or instances) on which your application for end users runs. After verifying your implementation and functions on your development environment, you can deploy implementation to your production environment.

## Development Environment

The development environment is the environment where we process our development, testing and debugging for any application or program. The development environment helps the developer to tests code and checks whether the application runs successfully with that code. Once the application has been tested and the developer feels that the code is working fine, then the developer moves the application to next server.

## Site Configuration Sync

LoginRadius provides an easy-to-use syncing tool to transfer or clone the configuration settings from one environment to the other. You can utilize this feature if you have multiple instances/sites. For example,  if you have 2 instances - development and production, you will be able to implement and test the features in the development environment. Then, with the site configuration sync feature you can roll over those same settings to your production environment once they are ready to go live.
