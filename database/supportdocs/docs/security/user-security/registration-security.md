# Registration Security

---

As part of Customer Identity and Access Management, LoginRadius provides you with the ability to have control over your user registrations, from putting up reCAPTCHA restrictions to blocking out certain email addresses.

There are four available selections in the the Admin Console under Platform Security -> Account Protection -> Auth Security:

- CAPTCHA Setting
- Access Restriction
- Brute Force Lockout

## CAPTCHA Setting

The CAPTCHA Setting area allows you to enable Google reCAPTCHA/QQ TENCENT CAPTCHA/hCaptcha as part of your log in & registration flows for additional security.

Review our [Auth Security](/api/v2/admin-console/platform-security/auth-security-configuration#captchasetting0) documentation for more details.

## Access Restrictions

The Access Restrictions area can be used to block registration from spam or disposable emails and allows you to control access or registration to your LoginRadius site based on your end-users' email addresses.

Review our [Auth Security](/api/v2/admin-console/platform-security/auth-security-configuration#accessrestrictions1) documentation for more details.

## Brute Force Lockout

In this section, you are able to further customize your registration form by enabling/disabling and configuring the Brute Force Lockout feature. This allows you to restrict account access based on failed log in attempts.

Review our [Auth Security](/api/v2/admin-console/platform-security/auth-security-configuration#bruteforcelockout2) documentation for more details.
