# LoginRadius Global CDN 


LoginRadius is committed to delivering the best quality and performance to our customers by utilizing the world's best-in-class CDN services and cloud providers. By employing multiple failover layers, we can ensure a 100% uptime to provide our customers with the fastest and most reliable Customer Identity and Access Management (cIAM) platform.

LoginRadius Global CDN offers the following features:


## Cookieless Domain

LoginRadius has created two cookieless domains - lrcontent.com and lrcontent2.com - as the preferred method to deliver performance and quality via CDN. 


> **Note:** The CDN domain, cdn.loginradius.com, has been deprecated and is no longer recommended for content delivery. It is a part of the loginradius.com domain, and its script-based components can create cookies.

## Redundant Failover and Optimized Performance

LoginRadius is committed to providing 100% uptime for our CDN services by maintaining real-time failover.

While doing so, we have created two CDN origins for each content file with lrcontent.com and lrcontent2.com.

```
https://auth.lrcontent.com/v2/LoginRadiusV2.js
https://auth.lrcontent2.com/v2/LoginRadiusV2.js
```

## CDN Failover Infrastructure


### 1. Server-side Traffic Manager Failover

Our Traffic Manager automatically detects the  CDN availability and retrieves the content from the nearest available CDN if the primary source is unavailable.

### 2.  Client-side JS Failover

This failover is applied directly to the client browser, and it's necessary to incorporate the script mentioned [here](/api/v2/user-registration/user-registration-getting-started#initializationofloginradiusobject3) on your website to implement this failover. If the content fails to reach its destination or load, the script will retrieve the content from the failover location.



## Fastest CDN Networks

The LoginRadius CDN infrastructure utilizes the best-in-industry CDN providers. By combining multiple CDN providers, we deliver a 100% uptime for our CDN content delivery. By taking advantage of the CDN providersâ€™ global networks, we can assure the fastest delivery time with the lowest latency period across the globe.


Attributes used by the LoginRadius multi-CDN services are:

- Proper caching headers
- Gzip compression is applied to the CDN
