Social Data Compliance
====
-----
The LoginRadius platform provides built-in support for Social Network APIs. We have integrated 35+ social networks into the LoginRadius Platform. Social networks have various APIs such as Authentication, User Profile Data, Likes, Groups, as well as Media APIs - Audio, Albums, Picture, Video, etc. LoginRadius is able to integrate all of these APIs into one single format and normalize the data into one LoginRadius data format. Customer needs to only work with LoginRadius API to work with all Social Networks.

As an authentication provider, LoginRadius doesn't store the users' social network passwords. Rather, we facilitate the authentication process with a unique access token received from the social network (ID Provider). LoginRadius' customers create their own social network apps for ID providers (Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.) and host the app credentials with the LoginRadius API, which manages the authentication process.

LoginRadius promotes and encourages our customer to comply with the social networks' privacy policy when these social network logins are implemented on their website or mobile apps. The LoginRadius Privacy Team can also help determine these policies, so please feel free to reach out to your account manager should you have any questions about this. If your application does not meet the social network's privacy compliance, LoginRadius may terminate your services.

We provide various guides to assist with your app setup, as well as some best practices and informational documents:
