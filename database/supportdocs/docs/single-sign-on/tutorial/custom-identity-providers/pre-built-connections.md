# Pre-Built Connections

LoginRadius supports a pre-built template to expedite deploying some of the frequently leveraged custom identity providers enabling users to authenticate with the identity provider (IdP) and access multiple service provider (SP) apps through LoginRadius. For those seeking advanced configurations, the configuration options are conveniently located under the respective protocol tab, offering a comprehensive and tailored approach to identity management.

Presently, LoginRadius supports the pre-built integration template for the below-mentioned providers.

1. Salesforce
2. Azure AD
3. Google Workspace
4. PingIdentity
5. Okta

Now, let's delve deeper into the configuration steps.

## Configuring Pre-Built Connections

1. Navigate to [Platform Configuration > Custom IDPs > Integrations](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/platform-configuration/authentication-configuration/custom-idps/integrations) in the Admin Console and click on **Add SSO Integration**.

4. In the **Name** field, enter a unique name for your Salesforce or any other integration.
        
    > **Note:** Below are the validation rules that should be taken care of while creating the Provider Name. If any of the below validation rules is not followed the error message: `App Name is not valid` will be shown.

    - Only **\_** (underscore) and **-** (hyphen) are allowed as a special charater.
    - The app name should start with a character.
    - Alphanumeric values are allowed.
    - No space is allowed in between.
    - The minimum length of the app name should be **[1]** and a maximum length up to **[60]** is allowed.
    - Now all the app names are allowed in lowercase only. If the uppercase is entered it will be automatically converted in lowercase.

5. In the **ID Provider Location** field, enter the location to which an SP (Service Provider) sends assertions using whichever protocol and binding it shares with the IdP (Identity Provider).

6. In the **ID Provider Logout URL** field, enter the Sign-Out Endpoint that you get from the SAML account.

7. In the **ID Provider Certificate** field, enter the certificate for IdP and click on the **SAVE** button.

8. Upon saving the configuration, the screen below will emerge, presenting additional steps outlined within the **Tutorial** tab. These steps guide you through the necessary configurations to be implemented in the Salesforce or any other integration’s developer console.
