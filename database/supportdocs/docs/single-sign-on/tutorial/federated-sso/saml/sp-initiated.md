# Service Provider Initiated Login (SAML)

---

In this document, we will go through the **Service Provider (SP)** initiated SAML flow. SP initiated login flow is the process in which **Service Provider** creates a SAML **request** and forwards the user and the SAML request to the Identity Provider, after authentication the Identity Provider sends a signed SAML response having an [assertion](/single-sign-on/federated-sso/saml/overview/#assertions3) to the **Service Provider Assertion Consumer Service** endpoint. This flow will be initiated by a login button in the Service Provider.

Flow diagram for **SP initiated** SAML workflow:

Here’s how the **SP Initiated** SAML flow works with LoginRadius.

1. The user requests to **access a protected resource** by clicking a Login Link on the **Third-party service provider**.

2. Service Provider use its own **SAML private key** to sign the SAML request and a **certificate** containing SP public key should be given to the IdP to validate the signature.

3. The service provider initiates the login process by sending a SAML **request** to the **identity provider** for authenticating the user.

4. If the SAML request is signed then LoginRadius validates the signature of the SAML request.

5. The user will be redirected to the LoginRadius **IDX login page**.

6. The user enters their LoginRadius user credentials .

7. After successful authentication, the **Identity Provider (LoginRadius)** signs the SAML Response with the **LR (IDP)** private key.

8. The IDP will then send a signed SAML response to the SP’s Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL. The SAML response contains a SAML assertion that tells the service provider who the user is.

9. The service provider **validates the SAML response** with the stored certificate value provided by IdP and identifies the user.

10. The user is **now logged** in to the service provider and can access the protected resource.

## SAML App Configuration Guide (SP Initiated)

This guide will take you through the process of setup and implementation of the SP initiated SSO. It covers everything you need to configure in your LoginRadius account.

You are required to configure a **SAML app** in the LoginRadius Admin Console and third-party **Service Provider**.

1. [Configure the SAML App in LoginRadius Admin Console](#configuringsamlapp1)
2. [Configure Service Provider Application](#configureserviceproviderapplication2)

### Configuring SAML App

This section covers the required configurations that you need to perform in the LoginRadius Admin Console to implement the SP initiated flow.

> **NOTE**: If you have enabled or added a **Custom Domain** for your existing application, please be aware that you should **replace** the URL `https://<LoginRadius Site Name>.hub.loginradius.com/` with `https://<Your Custom Domain>/`  in fields such as **Issuer, EntityID, Login and Logout URLs**, or any fields having the same format.

**Step 1:** Log in to your [**Admin Console**](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/) account and navigate to [**Platform Configuration > Access Configuration > Federated SSO**](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/platform-configuration/access-configuration/federated-sso/saml).

The following screen will appear:

![SAML](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/sso-5_22896391953bde6252.19957916.png "SAML")

**Step 2:** To configure SAML App, in the Admin Console, click the **Add App** button highlighted in the screenshot below.

![Federated SSO - SAML](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/sso-8_3006663918ba4cc08a5.64659487.png "Federated SSO - SAML")

The SAML App configuration fields will appear on the same screen.

**Step 3:** Select **SP Initiated Login** from **Login Flow** options as displayed in the above screenshot.

![SAML Full view](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/sp_99150576425c20db0b566.68480111.png "SAML Full view")

**Step 4:** In the **SAML App Name** field, enter an App name. If you have multiple SAML apps, the app name should be unique for each.

**Step 5:** In the **Service Provider Certificate** field, enter the service provider's certificate.

**Step 6:** For **Attributes**, map the LoginRadius' fields with the Service Provider fields.

A) In **Name**, enter the field name of Service Provider.
<br> B) In **Format**, enter `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:unspecified`.
<br> C) In **Value**, enter LoginRadius mapping field name.
<br> D) Select **Static** checkbox to not update attribute on runtime in the value field, and it remains the same as entered. If you do not select the Static checkbox, the application will pick the email value from the customer’s profile.

Similarly, by clicking the **Add Row** button, you can map multiple attributes.

LoginRadius supports the following fields:

<br>

| Name        | Format                                                  | Value                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

> **Note:**
>
> - If you don't find the **Custom Field** in the drop-down list, select the **Other** from the **Value** dropdown of Attributes section and use dot notation to map the custom field on the basis of name.

       >  For e.g if the custom field name is **customfield1** then we can use it like **CutomFields.customfield1**.

> - The Roles field is of type array and will have multiple value **"Roles": ["Admin", "Manager"]**.

       >  You can access the Roles array value using the index for e.g if the role is on “0” index then it can beaccess like Roles[0].

**Step 7:** For Name Id Format, select name Id format that is supported by the Service Provider. The default is `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent`

**Step 8:** In **Login URL**, enter `https://<LoginRadius Site Name>.hub.loginradius.com/auth.aspx..`

**Step 9:** For **After Logout URL**, enter `https://<LoginRadius Site Name>.hub.loginradius.com/auth.aspx?action=logout`

**Step 10:** In the **Service Provider Logout URL**, enter the service provider logout URL (you will get the SLO URL from a third-party service provider). This Logout URL will be called in the Single Logout (SLO) SAML workflow.

**Step 11:** The **Default Request Binding**, select any of the binding values from the drop-down as per the service provider configuration, we support both types of binding values by default it will be urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST.

**Step 12:** In **Assertion Consumer Service Location**, enter location (you will get this from your service provider).

**Step 13:** In **Assertion Consumer Service Binding**, select the binding value as
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST` from the drop-down.

> **Note:** LoginRadius supports **POST** binding for assertion consumer service

**Step 14:** For **Relay State Parameter**, enter **RelayState**.

**Step 15:** For **App Audiences**, enter `https://<LoginRadius Site Name>.hub.loginradius.com/`. You can add more rows for App audiences to add multiple app audiences.

**Step 16:** Select **HTTPPost** from **SSO** Method.

**Step 17:** Click the **ADD** A SAML APP button to save the app settings.

> **Note:** The **Identity Provider Certificate** and its **Key** are now automatically generated from the backend in the Admin Console, with a default expiry time of **five years.**

Once you are done configuring the SAML app in the in Admin Console, you can view the recent success or error logs data for your SSO connection in the [Troubleshoot section](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/platform-configuration/access-configuration/federated-sso/trouble-shoot). To view the latest logs, click the Refresh button.

![SAML Logs](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/sso-7_2189663918b726e9a42.92739165.png "SAML Logs")

> **Note:** Currently, the Logs only supports the SAML flow.

### Configure Service Provider Application

Once you have successfully configured the SAML app in LoginRadius Admin Console, now you need to configure the third-party Service provider.

This document provides a step-by-step guide to configure the SAML SSO on the third-party service provider.

Each third-party authentication system is unique and will require different configuration settings.

> **NOTE**: If you have enabled or added a **Custom Domain** for your existing application, please be aware that you should **replace** the URL `https://<LoginRadius Site Name>.hub.loginradius.com/` with `https://<Your Custom Domain>/`  in fields such as **Issuer, EntityID, Login and Logout URLs**, or any fields having the same format.

Use the following values to configure your application for SP and IDP initiated login flow:

**Step 1:** Identity provider Login URL (SSO Endpoint): `https://<LoginRadius Site Name>/service/saml/idp/login?appname=<SAMLAppName>`

**Step 2:** Use the LoginRadius certificate in your Service Provider application. To obtain the LoginRadius certificate, which is automatically generated from the backend, you can download the metadata file from the Admin Console after completing the configuration process. Please refer to the screenshot below for further clarification.

  ![Metadata](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/metadata_379381277643fc8455ca438.21222777.png "Metadata")

After opening the downloaded metadata file, the certificate will be visible as below:

  ![certificate](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/certificate_617284963643fc8a9068e55.30320893.png "certificate")

**Step 3:** In the **Issuer** or **EntityID** fields, enter your LoginRadius site URL (we can enter any other Entity ID URL, and the same value should be added for the **APP AUDIENCES** field in the LoginRadius Admin Console.): `https://<LoginRadius Site Name>.hub.loginradius.com/`

**Step 4:** For **SSO binding** or **Service Provider Initiated Request Binding** select HTTP-POST

**Step 5:** Into the SAML Relay State enter this value: **redirect** (Service Provider Specific)

**Step 6:** Enter the Logout URL: `https://<LoginRadius Site Name>/service/saml/idp/logout?appname=<SAMLAppName>`

> **Note:** If SP supports Single Logout (SLO) feature, enter `https://<LoginRadius Site Name>/service/saml/idp/logout?appname=<SAMLAppName>` for Logout URL in SP application.
