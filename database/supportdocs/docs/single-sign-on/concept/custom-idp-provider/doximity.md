**Step 1:** Log in to your[ **LoginRadius Admin Console**](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/) and navigate to [**Platform Configuration > Authentication Configuration > Custom IDPs > OAuth Provider **](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/platform-configuration/authentication-configuration/custom-idps/oauth-provider).

**Step 3: Provider Name:** Enter the **Doximity** under the Provider Name. This name will be displayed under the social login forms in the LoginRadius Identity Framework page as well as on the social login form rendered by LoginRadius V2.js library on the customer’s web application.

**Step 4: Extra Parameter In Redirect To Provider (Optional):** Enter the extra options (if any) supported by the provider apart from the default options (it varies from provider to provider).

**Step 5: Customer Login Endpoint:** Enter the OAuth end-point https://auth.doximity.com/oauth/authorize. This endpoint works as an authorization URL.

**Step 6: Access Token Endpoint:** Enter the OAuth end-point https://auth.doximity.com/oauth/token, from where the Access token can be retrieved.

**Step 7: Application Key:** Enter your Doximity application API key.

**Step 8: Application Secret:** Enter your Doximity application API secret.

**Step 9: Application ID (Optional):** Enter your Doximity application ID.

**Step 10: Scope:** This is the scope desired from Doximity, by default you should put **basic**(default scope for Doximity).
For more information on the scopes refer to this [document](https://www.doximity.com/developers/documentation#oauth).

**Step 11:** Response Type: Enter the **code** as a type of response that Doximity is sending.

**Step 12: Customer Profile Endpoint:** Enter the Doximity end-point https://www.doximity.com/api/v1/users/current, where customer profile data can be retrieved.

**Step 13: Request Token HTTP Method:** Select POST as an **HTTP** method from the dropdown.

**Step 14: Access Token parameter name for API access(Optional):** For Doximity this parameter name is **access_token**.

**Step 15:** Among all the field types, **Data Mapping** is **mandatory** and use **Header.**

- **Header:** It can be used for those providers that pass the Access Token in the header. Enter the Provider’s header name in **Key** and add any of the LoginRadius **value** from the following in the Value field:
  - 'Bearer #accesstoken#'
  - '#idtoken#'
  - '#oauthsignature#'

  - **The profile Key:** Enter the Doximity field name corresponding to the LoginRadius field name.

> **Note:** The LoginRadius ‘ID’ field is the unique identifier for each profile attached to a LoginRadius customer account. Refer to the LoginRadius Data structure document for more details. The mapping of the LoginRadius 'ID' field (Loginradius field) is mandatory.

Here's what a mapping with minimal settings should look like:

| LoginRadius | Doximity |
| ----------- | -------- |
| ID          | id       |

**Step 16: Include In Social Schema:** If enabled, the Doximity integration login flow will l be included under the social login form in the LoginRadius Identity Experience Framework or the social login form generated by LoginRadius V2.js.

**Step 17:** Now, click the ADD button to add and save settings.

## Part 2: Setting up the Custom Doximity Social Login Icon

> **Note:** For this next step we highly recommend you familiarize yourself with customizing your social provider icons [here](https://www.loginradius.com/docs/api/v2/user-registration/user-registration-getting-started#socialinterfacecustomization10). Once you're ready to have the Doximity Social Login icon displayed on your website you will need to inject it via code.

See our general all-purpose document on setting up a Custom OAuth Provider Icon for this step [here](https://www.loginradius.com/docs/api/v2/custom-identity-provider/custom-oauth-provider#settingupthecustomicon1). Once this is complete you should now have Doximity available as a social icon:
