## WeChat Integration

WeChat is a popular Chinese social media service that provides instant messaging along with commerce and payment services. This document goes over the full process from start to finish of getting up and running with WeChat as a Social Login Provider with LoginRadius.

#### WeChat App Creation

1. You will need to make sure you have a WeChat account created via the WeChat mobile app.

2. On your computer you will need to sign up for a WeChat Developer account at: 

	[https://open.weixin.qq.com](https://open.weixin.qq.com)

	Choose 注册 (Register):

3. You will be prompted with a form to create a WeChat Developer account and to link your existing WeChat account to the Developer account.

4. Once you've logged in on your Developer Account go to

	管理中心 (Control Center) -> 网站应用 (Website Application)

	And hit 创建网站应用 还可创建 (Create a Website Application)

	![enter image description here](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/edit2-1_300995a061eb3cf4c21.90241457.png "")

	Now, you will either be prompted with the ability to create the application or to fill out a Developer verification form (If the Developer verification form has not been filled out yet, you will need to fill it out as WeChat only allows verified Developers to create apps).

	**Note:** During the application process WeChat will ask for a Callback URL, provide them with the following URL:

	https://<< YOUR LOGINRADIUS SITENAME >>.hub.loginradius.com

5. Once you've successfully created your app you will receive an AppID and AppSecret. Write it down as it will be required later.

1. Go to your [LoginRadius Admin Console](https://secure.loginradius.com) Under:

	|---|---|
	|ID|unionid|

You can also optionally map other WeChat fields to other 	LoginRadius fields as desired.



####Setting up the Custom WeChat Social Login Icon

**Note:** For this next step we highly recommend you familiarize yourself with customizing your social provider icons [here](/api/v2/user-registration/user-registration-getting-started#socialinterfacecustomization10). Once you're ready to have the WeChat Social Login icon displayed on your website you will need to inject it via code.

See our general all-purpose document on setting up a Custom OAuth Provider Icon for this step [here](/api/v2/custom-identity-provider/custom-oauth-provider#settingupthecustomicon1). Once this is complete you should now have WeChat available as a social icon:
