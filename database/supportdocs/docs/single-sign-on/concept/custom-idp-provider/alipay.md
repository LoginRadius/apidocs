**Step 9:** In the **Response Type** field, enter “code”.

**Step 10:** In the **Request Token HTTP Method** field, enter the HTTP method of Request Token “GET”.

**Step 11:** In the **Access Token Parameter Name For Api Access** field, enter ”applyToken”.

**Step 12:** **Header (optional)** can be used for those providers, which pass the Access Token in the header. Enter the Provider’s header name in **Key** and add any of the LoginRadius value from the  following in the **Value** field:

-#accesstoken# <br>
-#idtoken# <br>
-#oauthsignature#

**Step 13:** Pass the **Query params (optional)** from AliPay Provider in key and value pairs (if the AliPay supports query params).

**Step 14:** **Data Mapping** - Enter field mappings between AliPay fields and LoginRadius [user profile properties](/api/v2/getting-started/data-points/detailed-data-points/).

- **Select Field(Dropdown):** Select the LoginRadius field name which you want to map with respective Doximity field.
- **The profile Key:** Enter the Doximity field name corresponding to the LoginRadius field name.

You can also map more fields (as per your requirements) by clicking on the **Add Row** button. 
> **Notes:**
- The LoginRadius ‘ID’ field is the unique identifier for each profile attached to a LoginRadius customer account. Refer to the LoginRadius [Data structure](/api/v2/getting-started/data-points/data-points/#datastructure0) document for more details. The mapping of the LoginRadius 'ID' field (Loginradius field) is required for the OAuth Provider. A user will not be able to register/login if the value is missing for this mapping in the OAuth Provider.
- To make this social login work, you need to map the only field that is the **LoginRadius ID** field to the **AliPay unionid** field (it’s mandatory). 

**Step 15:** Now, click on the **ADD** button to add and save settings.

## Part 3- Custom AliPay Social Login Icon Configuration

For this step, we highly recommend you to familiarize yourself with customizing your social provider icons [here](/api/v2/user-registration/user-registration-getting-started#socialinterfacecustomization10). OOnce you're ready to have the AliPay Social Login icon displayed on your website, you will need to add it via code. 

Refer to our general all-purpose document on setting up a Custom OAuth Provider Icon for this step [here](/api/v2/custom-identity-provider/custom-oauth-provider#settingupthecustomicon1). Once this is complete, you should have AliPay available as a social icon.
