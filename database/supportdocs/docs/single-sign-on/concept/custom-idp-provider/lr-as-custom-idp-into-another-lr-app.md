# LoginRadius App as Custom IDP With Another LoginRadius App


LoginRadius can act as Identity Provider as well as Service Provider and establishes the trust and authentication process between the multiple applications using the industry-standard protocols ( SAML, OIDC, Oauth and JWT).

  

If you have multiple LoginRadius applications and wants to create a smooth experience for the consumer by unifying their accounts and allowing them to login with one identity, you can leverage any industry-standard protocols ( SAML, OIDC, Oauth and JWT) to create single sign-on workflow where on one LoginRadius application acts as Identity Provider and other LoginRadius application act as service Provider.

  

This document provides a step-by-step guide to configure a LoginRadius application as Custom IDP using the OAuth workflow with your other LoginRadius application.
