# LoginRadius as IDP with JIRA as SP

This document explains how you can establish SSO between LoginRadius Identity Provider and JIRA where JIRA is a service provider. The implementation is based on the SAML protocol.

Let’s say you are using the LoginRadius Identity Platform for your company portal and require that your employees access the JIRA account using the portal’s credentials. Reason being that you don't want the employees to remember the multiple login credentials (one for portal and one for JIRA account).

## JIRA as SP Configuration Guide

This guide will take you through the setup and implementation of the LoginRadius as IDP and JIRA as SP based SSO. It covers everything you need to configure in your LoginRadius Admin Console and JIRA Application.

> **Pre-requisites:** 
>- An administrator account for JIRA.
>- JIRA Software Server based on your machine OS.
>- SAML feature is enabled for your account in LoginRadius Admin Console.
>- LoginRadius JIRA Plugin.
>- A public certificate(X.509) and private key pair are required to connect applications with LoginRadius. [Learn how to manage certificates and private keys](https://www.ssls.com/knowledgebase/how-can-i-find-the-private-key-for-my-ssl-certificate/).

## Part 1 - Configuration in JIRA

This section covers the required configurations that you need to perform in the JIRA application to implement this flow.

> **NOTE**: If you have enabled or added a **Custom Domain** for your existing application, please be aware that you should **replace** the URL `https://<LoginRadius Site Name>.hub.loginradius.com/` with `https://<Your Custom Domain>/`  in fields such as **Issuer, EntityID, Login and Logout URLs**, or any fields having the same format.

**Step 1:** Register for a JIRA account, and you should be having the **Admin Access**. You can create a JIRA account from [here](https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-software&edition=free).

**Step 11:** Configure the LoginRadius Jira app, as explained below:

**Basic Configurations**

- **SAML Endpoint:** `http://localhost:8080/plugins/servlet/saml/auth`, use this URL in your IdP to initiate a SAML login
- LoginButton Text: Give a name to your login initiator button.
- **Entity ID:** Your site URL. For example: `https://<your-app-name>.hub.loginradius.com/`

- **Logout URL:** `https://<LoginRadius Site Name>/service/saml/idp/logout?apikey=<APIKey>&appname=<SAMLAppName>`

    **Note:** Your apiKey and SAML App name can be found under the LoginRadius [**Admin Console -> Platform Security -> Data Access Protection -> API Credentials ->Account API Keys**](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/platform-security/data-access-protection/api-credentials/account-api-keys).

- **X.509 Certificate:** Add your X.509 certificate value here. For more information on how to generate a certificate and key, you can refer to this [document](/single-sign-on/concept/saml-miscellaneous/certificate/).

> **Note:**  You need to set **End Of Line** Conversion for Linux Server in X.509 certificates.

**Advanced Configurations**

- **Maximum Authentication Age:** Maximum Authentication Age (in Seconds) i.e., for how long the SSO session remains active.
- **Force SSO login(optional):** If checked, all Jira logins will be made through SSO only. You are strongly encouraged to test SSO thoroughly before checking this box. Otherwise, you may get locked out of Jira.
- **Auto-create User(optional):** If checked, the user will be automatically created on successful login, using data from SAML attributes.
- **Enable ServiceDesk(optional):** If checked, your users will be automatically logged in the ServiceDesk customer portal.
