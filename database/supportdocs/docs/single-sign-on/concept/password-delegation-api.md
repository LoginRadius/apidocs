# Password Delegation API

The Password Delegation feature allows you to authenticate a user for which password is stored with a third-party application during the initial login. This process allows you to provide a seamless authentication process when migrating customer bases to LoginRadius without needing to provide passwords to LoginRadius during the data migration process. 

## Password Delegation Guide
This guide will take you through the process to set up and implement the **Password Delegation** feature for a third party application that doesn't want you to migrate passwords away from their platform. 

**For example**, if you are using a **BigCommerce** application, which doesn't allow you to migrate passwords or password hashes from BigCommerce to LoginRadius, you can leverage the Password Delegation API to validate the login credentials. Once you receive a success message in the response, you can ask the customer to create a password in LoginRadius/ your application. Once the password is updated in LoginRadius, you can use the [Auth Login By Email](/api/v2/customer-identity-api/authentication/auth-login-by-email/) to authenticate the user using LoginRadius API.

## Part 1 - Configuration

This section covers the required configurations that you need to perform in the LoginRadius Admin Console to configure your password delegation request. The following are the configuration steps:

**Step 1:** Log in to your <a href = https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/ target=_blank>**Admin Console**</a> account, navigate to <a href = https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/platform-configuration/access-configuration/delegation/password-delegation target=_blank> **Platform Configuration > Delegation >Password Delegation**</a>
