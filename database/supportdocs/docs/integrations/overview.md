# Integrations Overview

LoginRadius Integrations allow you to sync data from your LoginRadius Cloud Database to other 3rd party systems, as well as sync back the data from the 3rd party systems to your LoginRadius Cloud Database. Hence, two-way syncing of data is supported and the data is identified based on the LoginRadius Unique Identifier (UID).

The LoginRadius Integrations help businesses create a central hub for customer data. Customers can collect data from registration and log in events, along with other attached events such as web page views, button clicks, or other specific actions performed on your app or site, and send it to over 100 different integrations available on the platform. The data that is sent through LoginRadius is normalized into the [LoginRadius data schema](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/api/v2/user-registration/detailed-data-point) and will be mapped based on the 3rd party system’s data schema.

## Benefits of using the LoginRadius Integrations

#### Automate Data Integrations

Cut out the need to build and maintain connectors to third-party APIs and get real-time data transfers that are always working. Through the integration platform, you can quickly and easily update mappings and flows to handle any tweaks to the automated actions that you have set up

#### Unify and Centralize Data
Keep all of your data in one location (LoginRadius Cloud Storage) and allow for your ecosystem’s different applications to leverage the data that is relevant to them.

#### Customized Data Mapping
Quickly and easily map the LoginRadius Cloud Storage data fields to your third-party applications and update these mappings at any time via the LoginRadius dashboard. This allows you to manage the data that is flowing from LoginRadius to the third party from a GUI without the need to update the code or develop new connectors.

#### Pre-defined Triggers
Choose from more than 40 action triggers to initiate the communication with the third party application. Set up one or more triggers for each application to make sure your data is always up to date.

#### Custom Rules and Filters
Set up rules, conditions, and filters based on your business requirements to control when and how data will be fed to the third party systems. This allows you to control the data flow by choosing the conditions that a given action must meet in order for the transference of data to occur.

#### Two-way Syncing
Use the integration platform to not only send data to third-party applications but also to accept data into LoginRadius. This allows you to have centralized storage residing in the LoginRadius Cloud Storage and guarantees that you always have an accurate, up to date dataset.

#### Automated API Updates
Eliminate the need to monitor and maintain third party APIs. LoginRadius handles all of the maintenance and compliance, allowing you to focus on leveraging the data instead of maintaining the connectors.

## Types of Integration

The LoginRadius Integrations section covers six types of Integrations:

1. **Cloud Connectors**: The server-side integration handles server to server communications between the LoginRadius Cloud Storage and third-party applications. This section contains documentation on how to configure integrations that can interact with back-end services.

2. **Client Side Connectors:** In order to make interactions easier, LoginRadius provides it's own Client-Side Integrations Platform which contains a multitude of pre-built Client facing integrations that are highly customizable. In other words, this integration is used to process the data points directly from the customer’s web browser and send it to the third-party application using the LoginRadius Client Library.

3. **Third Party Integration Platform**: This section is dedicated to integrations that feed data into other integration providers. 

4. **IoT Internet Of things:** This section contains documentation for setting up LoginRadius with Internet of Things devices.

5. **Marketplace**: You will find all of the different integrations that can be added on 3rd party applications that have their own Marketplace for integrations.

6. **Webhooks**: This section has all of the details surrounding the usage of Webhooks with the LoginRadius platform.

LoginRadius can integrate with dozens of third-party software to work seamlessly with your existing applications, delivering uninterrupted data flow and customer registration. Optimize ad campaigns, automatically create lead profiles, increase landing page conversion, and eliminate hundreds of development hours.
