# 3rd Party Integration Platforms Overview

The LoginRadius Integrations enable you to have a seamless integration between LoginRadius and other 3rd Party Integration Platforms/Services. There are different types of integrations available depending on the 3rd Party Integration Platforms/Services you choose, and each may use its own specifications. This document provides an overview of the different types of 3rd Party Integration Platforms/Services supported by LoginRadius.

## Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS)
LoginRadius has connectors available for Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) platforms as part of our Integrations. These platforms facilitate building out integrations by providing you access to different pre-built "connectors" and allowing you to build and configure logical workflows using these connectors often without the need for programming.

> **Note:** Due to the nature of the business model around iPaaS providers, some may only be available at an additional cost, if you're interested in having a LoginRadius connector for a specific iPaaS platform, please contact [LoginRadius Support](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/support/tickets/open-a-new-ticket).

## Front-End Integration Platforms
Some 3rd Party Integration Platforms facilitate building out integrations on the front-end by allowing you to easily configure which integrations you want to enable on the front-end and how you would like the data to be collected. Currently, LoginRadius offers a Cloud Connector with [Segment](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/api/v2/integrations/3rd-party-integration-platforms/segment) via the [LoginRadius Client-Side Cloud Connectors](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/api/v2/integrations/client-side-integrations/getting-started).
