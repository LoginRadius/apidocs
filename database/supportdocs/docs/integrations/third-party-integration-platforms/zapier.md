This document goes over setting up a Zap with LoginRadius that feeds subscriber info into a Mailchimp list when a user registers. We chose Mailchimp as it's the most common integration, however, you can use any of the other apps available on Zapier to follow this document.

**Note:** This feature is an add-on, please contact <a href = https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/support/tickets/open-a-new-ticket target=_blank> LoginRadius Support Team</a>for details.

6. For this next step we will need to choose an "Action", this is where we decide what we want to happen when the trigger is triggered (somebody registers, in our case). For this example let's have choose "Mailchimp" to have Mailchimp add anyone who Registers added to a Mailchimp list.

7. choose the "Add/Update Subscriber" option.
