# Google Analytics

---

Google analytics is the first choice when people want to analyze activity on their site. This is because it not only provides information on users, such as their locations, languages, or which kind of device they are using to browse a given site but with some customization, it can also track the behavior and events occurring on the site. It can be very helpful to figure out which button has the most clicks or which social provider is favored by your users. (See what Google Analytics can do [here](https://www.google.com/analytics))

All of the features above are done by the Google Analytics JavaScript code, which is known as analytics.js or universal JavaScript, and it would be very good practice for LoginRadius users to combine it with the LoginRadius analytics tracking code. There are three major benefits of doing this:
1. Automatically track events which are happening; 
2. Assign unique social IDs to users in order to gain more precise results; 
3. Customize the advanced tracking in a very simple way.

>**Note:** 
- The basic implementation takes about 20 minutes.
- Before you go any further, make sure your Google Analytics has been activated. It may take up to 24 hrs for it to activate for the first time.

##Implementation

You will first need the following JavaScript files (you may have some of them already, make sure the order of the scripts is correct).

Deploy the LoginRadius V2 JS

```
<script src="https://auth.lrcontent.com/v2/js/LoginRadiusV2.js"></script>
```

Deploy the LoginRadius V2 Integration JS

```
<script src="https://auth.lrcontent.com/v2/js/LoginRadiusV2.Integrations.js"></script>
```

###Google Analytics Universal JS
Start with Google Analytics from [here](http://www.google.com/analytics).

In your Google Analytics Admin-console, go to: 'Admin' -> 'Property' -> 'Tracking Info' -> 'Tracking Code' - copy 'Global Site Tag'and paste without modification under the script of html.

If you are using PHP as your back-end language, it is recommended to put the script in a separate file, and include it in the page you want to track.

### Identifying Users

With Google Analytics, the only way to identify a user is via a distinct ID. Google explicitly states that you cannot use personal information to link tracking information with an individual. If found doing so, **you risk losing all your analytics as well as termination to your account.**
Read more about this condition [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2795983?hl=en) as well as [here](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html)

- Call our identify function to link the account

`LRObject.identify("ga",response.Profile,mapping)`

```
<script>
    var mapping={
        standard:[
                "uid"
                ]}
    var commonOptions = {};
    commonOptions.apiKey = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';
    commonOptions.appName = 'XXXXX';
    var  LRObject = new LoginRadiusV2(commonOptions);
    var login_options = {};
    login_options.onSuccess = function(response) {
    //On Success
    // Use to syncing User Id with google Analytis tracking Id.
    LRObject.identify("ga",response.Profile,mapping)
    console.log(response);
    };
    login_options.onError = function(errors) {
    //On Errors
    console.log(errors);
    };
    login_options.container = "login-container";
    LRObject.util.ready(function() {
    LRObject.init("login",login_options);
    });
</script>
```

- The specifics on how to use this is in the [Getting Started](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/api/v2/integrations/getting-started)

- Once you call this method, we handle the linking between a persons' UID -> Google's Client ID

To reiterate, **we only link the customers' UID to their Google's client ID, nothing more.**

### Custom Mapping

For whatever reason, if you wish to handle this client ID linking by yourself manually through the LR method. You are able to do so by setting isCustom == true as well as passing data as a string type.

Example

```
var data = "12345"
<script>
    var commonOptions = {};
    commonOptions.apiKey = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';
    commonOptions.appName = 'XXXXX';
    var  LRObject = new LoginRadiusV2(commonOptions);
    var login_options = {};
    login_options.onSuccess = function(response) {
    //On Success
    // Use to syncing User Id with google Analytis tracking Id.
    LRObject.identify("ga",data,'', true)
    console.log(response);
    };
    login_options.onError = function(errors) {
    //On Errors
    console.log(errors);
    };
    login_options.container = "login-container";
    LRObject.util.ready(function() {
    LRObject.init("login",login_options);
    });
</script>

```

### Why is this Important?

Google Analytics, by default, identifies customers with your browsers 'cookie'. At first visit to your website, it saves a cookie in your local browser. On a second or more visit, GA will be able to determine that it is the same person with the cookie in the browser. This may be problematic if that user is using their phone to access your website because now the one user has two 'users' on Google Analytics. Our identity is an excellent solution because it links the Uid (a unique ID associated with one user's account) and provides accurate data for one user no matter what browser or platform they're using.

### Tracking Events

###LoginRadius Tracking Setting Script

```
<script>
    var commonOptions = {};
    commonOptions.apiKey = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';
    commonOptions.appName = 'XXXXX';
    var  LRObject = new LoginRadiusV2(commonOptions);
    //In order to task all events (tradtional and Social)
    LRObject.track('ga');
    var login_options = {};
    login_options.onSuccess = function(response) {
    //On Success
    console.log(response);
    };
    login_options.onError = function(errors) {
    //On Errors
    console.log(errors);
    };
    login_options.container = "login-container";
    LRObject.util.ready(function() {
    LRObject.init("login",login_options);
    });
</script>
```

### Tracking Setting

Track all events (social and Traditional)

```
<script>
    LRObject.track('ga');
</script>
```

### Filtered Tracking Setting

If you want to track the behavior when specific event fired then use the following code:

- Single Event:

```
<script>
    LRObject.track('ga', eventName); //eventName = ['login']
</script>
```

- Multiple event:

```
<script>
    LRObject.track('ga', eventName); //eventName = ['login', 'registration']
</script>
```

### View the data in Google Analytics

Make sure every JavaScript file is put in the correct order.

Click on any event (social and traditional) from your LoginRadius interface, and it will send an event to your Google Analytics Admin-console.
View the data and information.
(It can take up to 24 hours for Google Analytics to show the data.)
