## Overview

Microsoft Dynamics CRM is a customer management solution that is hosted by Microsoft to manage enterprise customer bases. LoginRadius has created some plugins that can be used to interface with your Dynamics application and will allow you to view and manage your LoginRadius users through the interface of Dynamics CRM.

Note: On-premises solutions may involve a different installation method.

## Designing Your Own Plugins

1. Make a new solution in Visual Studio as Class Library (.NET Framework). Name as desired plugin name.

2. Copy the packages folder from an existing plugin into the solution root directory

3. Copy the contents of the bin\debug folder to the corresponding one within the solution

4. Copy the References XML fields from another project's csproj and place it in the csproj of the new solution

5. Change the TargetFrameworkVersion in the new csproj to "v4.5.2"

6. Rename the C# file in the project from Class1 to the desired name.

7. Right click the project name in Solution Explorer and click Properties > Signing. Tick Sign the assembly and Select <New...> from the Choose a strong name key file dropdown.

8. Enter a Key file name (Name is PluginKey for the other plugins) and uncheck Protect my key file with a password, then click OK.

9. Complete the implementation of your plugin with the C# code and build to make sure a dll is successfully created.

10. On the Dynamics 365 portal for the organization, access Settings > Solutions and open the LoginRadius Authentication solution settings
