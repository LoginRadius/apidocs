Zendesk App Integration
===================================
-------------------------


The LoginRadius Zendesk App Integration allows you to get quick access to recent information on your Customers when reading your Zendesk tickets. It operates by pulling all of the profiles stored in LoginRadius associated to a customer by using the email listed in the given Zendesk ticket.

6. You will be prompted with a configuration form –you can leave most of the fields at their default values unless you plan on changing them. However, you **must** provide your [LoginRadius API Key and Secret](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/api/v2/admin-console/get-api-key-and-secret) along with your [LoginRadius Sitename](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/api/v2/admin-console/deployment/get-site-app-name/). Hit "Install" once you're ready.

7. The integration is now active. When a customer sends in a ticket, you will be able to see the customer's profiles directly on the right-hand side of the ticket. The integration automatically pulls the customer's information from LoginRadius based on the email of the customer stored in Zendesk.
