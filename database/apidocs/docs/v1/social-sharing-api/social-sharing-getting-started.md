#####Description of the Steps:
Steps for implementing the permission-based API social sharing. See an example of permission-based sharing here:

- Display the social sharing providers that you want to offer sharing with using the [Interface Customization API](/api/v1/social-login/social-login-getting-started)
- Enable the "Profile Access Permissions" for the Social ID providers within your LoginRadius User Account. Please find more details [here](/development/social-network/social-networks-permissions)
- Setup the Sharing Content - Choose to either have predefined sharing fields/content or display an interface to retrieve the customer input for the sharing content or any combination of the two.
- Call the Post API and pass in the collected or predefined parameters to share the message to the selected social provider.
- The API returns a bool that will identify whether or not the share was successful.
