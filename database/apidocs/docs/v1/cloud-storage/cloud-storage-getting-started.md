After users log into your site, you want to see the analytics or get further details about how the information is stored in your LoginRadius Cloud Directory or feed this data into a third party application, You can utilize the Identity or Aggregation API in order to retrieve bulk or aggregate user data.

##Cloud Directory
The LoginRadius Cloud Directory system is comprised of two APIs: Identity API and Aggregation API. It allows you to quickly view individual user data-sets, or get a broad overview of your user-base through aggregated user details. This system also provides you with the ability to recognize your users across your entire ecosystem, while simultaneously providing your users hassle-free navigation across all of your properties via [LoginRadius Single Sign On](/api/v1/single-sign-on/sso-overview).
