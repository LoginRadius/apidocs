List of editable data fields
===========

----------


As part of the LoginRadius Identity Platform, the user profile data fields are automatically pre-filled from social login (if social login is enabled) or they get processed and generated by LoginRadius internal system based on end-user's location/application data.

Please see the list of data fields which can be edited/updated using UserProfile APIs. The fields that are not specified in this list are read-only fields and can't be updated.
