#### How to get the notification for the changes and enhancements in the LoginRadius Platform?

The LoginRadius [changelog](https://www.loginradius.com/docs/api/changelog/) is a critical point of information covering changes and updates to the LoginRadius platform. We have added a dedicated RSS Feed, which will allow you to get notifications automatically for these changes using the RSS feed reader.


## RSS Feed 

You can add the changelogs RSS Feed link ([https://www.loginradius.com/docs/api/changelog/feed/](https://www.loginradius.com/docs/api/changelog/feed/)) in any of your subscribed RSS feed reader tools/extensions to get the notification to your email. 

> **Note:** To subscribe to the feed, you must use some RSS feed reader extension on your browser, and once the extension is installed, you can add the RSS feed in subscribed URLs.

If you are not subscribed to any RSS feed reader service, here are some of the free external services that you can use to get the latest updates directly in your Email Inbox.


- [Blogtrottr](https://blogtrottr.com/): Simply add the LoginRadius changelog RSS feed URL to get the notification to your email address.
- [https://feedrabbit.com/](https://feedrabbit.com/): This service also requires you to Enter the LoginRadius changelog RSS feed URL and the updates will be delivered to your inbox. \
