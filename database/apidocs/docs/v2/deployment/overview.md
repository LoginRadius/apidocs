# Overview

This document covers all of the possible implementation methods that will help you to deploy the LoginRadius Solution in quick or no time. It basically includes the deployment of LoginRadius solution via all the well-known methods like JavaScript libraries, web-based SDKs, Mobile SDKs, IDX and turn-key plugins, as well as, secure credentials for connecting these to the LoginRadius SaaS platform. For the detailed information and complete deployment guide, you can refer [here](/libraries/overview/).

LoginRadius Identity Platform allows you to deploy the solution in the following methods:

## JavaScript Libraries

LoginRadius provides a library of pre-written JavaScript functions which allows quick and easier implementation of LoginRadiusâ€™ features. It is one of the most basic web-based implementation methodologies available with LoginRadius. There are many built-in options for customization available in this JavaScript library. For advanced development, it includes [JavaScript hooks](/libraries/js-libraries/javascript-hooks/) and [JavaScript form libraries](/libraries/js-libraries/js-form-library/). For more details around this, have a look at the **JavaScript library** [documentation](/libraries/js-libraries/getting-started/).

## SDK Libraries
These web-bases SDK libraries have been developed with the purpose of making the implementation easier in commonly used web platforms like Java, Node.js, PHP, ASP.NET, Ruby and many more. The main advantage of using these SDKs is their native approach to making API calls and handling their responses. These SDKs are entirely open-source, allowing you to build off and modify the code to serve your unique requirements. For more details around this, have a look at the SDK library [documentation](/libraries/sdk-libraries/overview/).

## Mobile SDKs
Mobile SDKs basically follow a similar approach like the web-based SDK but their scope of implementation remains limited to the mobile platforms. The mobile SDKs provide native implementations in mobile technologies like Android, iOS, Xamarin, PhoneGap, and Ionic. They're easy to use and offer similar advantages in mobile devices, as web SDK does for web applications. These are open-sourced and use technologies such as REST API and OAuth 2.0. For more details around this, have a look at the Mobile SDK library [documentation](/libraries/turn-key-plugins/overview/).

## Turn-key Plugins
LoginRadius provides a variety of plugins that are built natively for CMS-based platforms like Drupal, Magento, WordPress, and many more. They're primarily used for quick integrations in consumer web applications for quick plug and play development. They allow you to get started within minutes with minimum programming skills. For more details around this, have a look at the Turn-key plugin [documentation](/libraries/turn-key-plugins/overview/).

## IDX Registration
 It is a ready-to-use yet customizable solution for all the necessary actions like Logins, registrations, etc. It allows you to set up registration and login pages quickly with very minimal technical knowledge. Also, the customization in this IDX implementation can be easily achieved using the <a href="https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/" target=_blank>LoginRadius Admin Console</a> with custom JS and CSS. For more details around this, have a look at the IDX Registration [documentation](/libraries/identity-experience-framework/overview/).
