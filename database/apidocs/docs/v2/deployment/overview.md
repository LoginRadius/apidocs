# Overview

This document covers all possible implementation methods to help you deploy the LoginRadius solution in quick or no time. It includes deploying the LoginRadius solution using various well-known methods such as JavaScript libraries, web-based SDKs, mobile SDKs, IDX, and turnkey plugins, as well as secure credentials for connecting to the LoginRadius SaaS platform. For detailed information and a complete deployment guide, please refer [here](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/libraries/overview/).

LoginRadius Identity Platform allows you to deploy the solution in the following methods:

## JavaScript Libraries

LoginRadius provides a library of pre-written JavaScript functions that allow for quick and easy implementation of LoginRadiusâ€™ features. This is one of the most basic web-based implementation methodologies available with LoginRadius. The JavaScript library includes many built-in customization options. For advanced development, it also includes [JavaScript hooks](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/libraries/js-libraries/javascript-hooks/) and [JavaScript form libraries](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/libraries/js-libraries/js-form-library/). For more details, refer to the JavaScript library [documentation](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/libraries/js-libraries/getting-started/).

## SDK Libraries
These web-bases SDK libraries have been developed with the purpose of making the implementation easier in commonly used web platforms like Java, Node.js, PHP, ASP.NET, Ruby, and many more. The main advantage of using these SDKs is their native approach to making API calls and handling their responses. These SDKs are entirely open-source, allowing you to build off and modify the code to serve your unique requirements. For more details about this, have a look at the SDK library [documentation](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/libraries/sdk-libraries/overview/).

## Mobile SDKs
Mobile SDKs basically follow a similar approach like the web-based SDK but their scope of implementation remains limited to the mobile platforms. The mobile SDKs provide native implementations in mobile technologies like Android, iOS, Xamarin, PhoneGap, and Ionic. They're easy to use and offer similar advantages in mobile devices, as web SDK does for web applications. These are open-sourced and use technologies such as REST API and OAuth 2.0. For more details about this, have a look at the Mobile SDK library [documentation](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/libraries/turn-key-plugins/overview/).

## Turn-key Plugins
LoginRadius provides a variety of plugins that are built natively for CMS-based platforms like Drupal, Magento, WordPress, and many more. They're primarily used for quick integrations in consumer web applications for quick plug and play development. They allow you to get started within minutes with minimum programming skills. For more details around this, have a look at the Turn-key plugin [documentation](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/libraries/turn-key-plugins/overview/).

## IDX Registration
This solution provides a ready-to-use yet customizable approach for essential actions such as logins and registrations. It enables you to set up registration and login pages quickly with minimal technical knowledge. Customization of this IDX implementation can be easily achieved using the [LoginRadius Admin Console](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/), where you can apply custom JS and CSS. For more information, refer to the IDX Registration [documentation](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/libraries/identity-experience-framework/overview/).
