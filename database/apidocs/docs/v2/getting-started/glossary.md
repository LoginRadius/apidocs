##Familiarize yourself with the terminology used within the LoginRadius ecosystem.


###A



**Access Token**

An access token is a unique identifier key generated by LoginRadius that is activated after a successful authentication. It is unique to each authenticated user and is different even when the same user authenticates the next time.
 
It is used to retrieve the user's profile data and to perform write-actions to the authenticated user's profile through the LoginRadius API
 For more details please see our Tokens documentation [here](/development/configuration/loginradius-tokens).

** **

It is used to retrieve the user's profile data and to perform write-actions to the authenticated user's social profile through the LoginRadius API.



**Access Token Life**

Access token life is the time period after your access token expires i.e. the time that you have access to a particular authenticated user's social profile. The default life of the access token in 15 minutes.


**Account Linking**

Account Linking allows you to provide a manner for customers to link their social provider accounts into a single unified account. For more details on this feature please read our account linking documentation [here](/libraries/identity-experience-framework/features-use-cases/#accountlinking2)



**API**

API is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API expresses a software component in terms of its operations, inputs, outputs, and underlying types.



**API Key & Secret **

This is a uniquely generated set of keys that will provide you access to a given API for your application. Generally speaking, an API Secret is known only to the owner and **must be kept private**.

We generate one set of API Key and Secret for each website to learn more, see [LoginRadius API Key](/api/v2/admin-console/platform-security/api-key-and-secret/) and [LoginRadius API Secret](/api/v2/admin-console/platform-security/api-key-and-secret/).



###C

**Callback**

A Callback is a concept in computer programming, when passing executable code as an argument to a function, it will be executed by that function. 

**Callback URL**

The Callback URL refers to the location that a user will return to after having completed the login/authentication process.

A Callback is a concept in computer programming, when passing executable code as an argument to a function, it will be executed by that function. 

**Custom Fields**

If you would like your user profiles to have a field that is not part of our existing [Profile Data Points](/api/v2/user-registration/detailed-data-point) you can create custom fields via your LoginRadius Admin Console by using our [Standard Login](/platform-features-overview/registration-services/standard-login) Registration Form feature.

Custom fields are specifically for simple textual data. For more complex data please see our Custom Objects feature.

**Custom Object**
A Custom Object is a schema-less object that can be attached to a specific account as shown in the below example. It can have a dynamic storage container that is updated with additional fields or data formats on the fly.

A Custom Object should be used if you are looking to store large amounts of user data and the data canâ€™t be formatted in a structured format because the data format could be different for each user. Please see our [Custom Object Overview](/user-profiling/custom-object-overview) for more details.

**Custom Scope**

Custom scope sets allow you to make permission-based social login, meaning you ask the user for additional permissions on a request basis going with the requirements for your site. for example you can ask the user for only "read permission" during social login and then you can ask for the "write permission" from the customer at a later point.



###D

**Data Points**

Data Points refers to the data that LoginRadius normalizes gathered through traditional forms or by different social providers. For more details on data points please see our [data points](/api/v2/data-points-and-response-code/data-points) documentation.

**Data Source**

A Data Source is a special type of custom field that holds large sets of key value pairs, It is created as part of our process for the [Custom Registration Data](/api/v2/custom-registration-data/registration-data-overview)workflow and is also designed to be easily configurable via API.



###E


**Editable data field**

LoginRadius provides a list of standard fields to be used for storing profile data, some of those standard fields can be edited via API while some of those fields are read-only.
You can learn more about editable fields in our [List of editable fields](/api/v2/data-points-and-response-code/list-of-editable-data-fields) document.

**Endpoint**

###H

**Hashing**

Hashing is one  of the methods for data security and data management on  the LoginRadius platform,  it performs one-way encryption for critical data such as passwords, security questions, etc. This is an algorithm that turns message or text into a fixed string of digits. By using one-way hashing, the stored information can only be matched, but cannot be decrypted.



###I

The ID (Also known as Provider ID) is the unique identifier for each profile attached to a LoginRadius UID. There will be a unique ID for each profile (i.e. "Facebook", "Twitter", "Email", etc.) associated with a given UID.

**Invisible ReCaptcha**

Invisible ReCaptcha is one of the methods that can be used for identifying if a user is human that is supported by LoginRadius along with the standard Google ReCaptcha. With this method users are not required to click on a checkbox, instead it is invoked directly when the user clicks on an existing button on your site, you can learn more about this feature [here](/api/v2/user-registration/advanced-customization#googlerecaptcha17).




###J



**JSON**

JSON is an open standard format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute-value pairs. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML.

**JWT (JSON Web Token)**

JWT is a method of establishing SSO (Single-Sign-On) connections that also happens to use JSON.
