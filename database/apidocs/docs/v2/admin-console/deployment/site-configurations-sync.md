# Site Configuration Sync

LoginRadius provides an easy-to-use syncing tool to transfer or clone the configuration settings from one LoginRadius environment to the other. In this case, the different LoginRadius instances have been provisioned under separate site licenses. Please see [here](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/api/v2/getting-started/loginradius-site-license-overview/) for further understanding on what a LoginRadius site license entails. The syncing tool can be found in the **Admin Console > Deployment > Configuration Deploy > Configuration Deployment**.

This configuration sync tool is used when there are multiple sites or LoginRadius instances. For example a customer with 2 instances - development and production - will be able to implement and test the features in the development environment, and use the sync tool to roll over those same settings to their production environment once they are ready to go live.

This tool also provides various options for you to select the specific configurations that you would like to sync. Below is a list in tabular form for the site configurations that can be transferred from one site to another:


| Column 1 |Column 2 |Column 3 |Column 4 | Column 5 |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |-- |--- |----|
|Advance workflow |Standard login>Registration data |SSO domain grouping |Remember Me |Age Verification |
| Email workflow | Phone login >Otp settings | Brute Force Lockout Settings |Security Questions | Web Apps |
| Email configuration | Password-less login> With email | Password Expiration | SMS Passcode Settings | Hosted |
| Global email settings | Password-less login> with OTP | Password History | Google Authenticator Settings | Self Hosted |

## Security Question

All of the Security Questions that have been customized in **Platform Security > Multi-Layered Security > Security Questions.**

## Multi Factor Authentication

All of the Multi-factor Authentication settings that can be found in **Platform Security > Multi-layered Security > Multi-Factor Authentication** If you want to transfer the SMS template for Multi-Factor Authentication, found it in **Platform Security > Multi-layered Security > Multi-Factor Authentication > SMS Passcode.**

## IDX

**All the IDX settings will be migrated from your source site to the destination site.**

**Note:** While using the configuration deployment on IDX, the same file location is updated from the source (development environment) to destination site ( production environment). Later on, when you want to make changes in development, if the IDX files, e.g. before.js is updated directly or uploaded with the same file name in the Admin Console under the development environment, it will be updated to both the development and production environment due to same file link.

**For example,** you have made changes to before.js file and uploaded with name before-rev1.js in your development site, and if you have performed configuration deploy by choosing **Identity Experience Framework Customization**, the same file network location is updated from the source (development environment) to destination site ( production environment) i.e before-rev1.js. After the sync, you want to further make changes in your development site, it is recommended to upload a new before.js file with a different name (e.g. before-rev2.js) other than before-rev1.js. Uploading the file with a different name creates a new network location URL in the LoginRadius platform. This prevents the changes made on the development site to be updated on the production site. Also, uploading the file with a different name reflects immediately ( there is no caching ).

## List of features that does not get cloned
