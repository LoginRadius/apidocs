# Security 

## Multi-Factor Authentication 

It is an enhanced account security process where an additional verification is required to log in to the [LoginRadius Admin console](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/). 

There are two ways to achieve Multi-Factor Authentication: 

- Verify identity via an **Authenticator** app.
- Verification via **SMS**.

### Configuration

### Authenticator App.

With the Google Authenticator app, you will receive an OTP via an Authenticator App installed on a mobile device to be consumed on your website after you have passed the traditional login procedure.

The first step to configure the Authenticator app is to enable it in your LoginRadius Admin Console. 

**Step 1:** Log in to your Admin Console, then navigate to [**My Account > Account Settings > Security**](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/account/account-settings/security). The following screen will appear.

**Step 2:** Click on the **Enable** button under **verify identity via an authenticator app**. The following screen will appear.

**2.1** Download and install the Google Authenticator or any other **Authenticator** app for your phone or tablet.

**2.2 Scan this Barcode** and open the authentication app and follow the steps below:

- Tap the **+** icon in the bottom-right of the app
- Scan the image to the left, using your phone's camera
 
**2.3 Enter Verification Code**

-  Once the barcode above is scanned, **enter the 6-digit verification code** generated by the app.
- Click on **verify code and activate** as mentioned on the below screen

 Now **Multi-factor authentication**  is enabled on your account.

### Backup Codes

If you lose access to your phone or otherwise can't get codes via **text**, or **Authenticator App**, you can use your **backup codes** to sign in. After you use a backup code to sign in, it becomes inactive. You can always generate a new set of **10 backup codes** whenever you want. After creating a new set, the old set automatically becomes inactive. 

After you have set up your **Multi-factor authentication** you will see the backup codes as given below.

>**Note:** We recommend you store your backup codes in some safe place, where you keep your other valuable items. Backup codes are only valuable to someone if they manage to get your password.
 

Once you have copied the code, the following screen will appear, you can **Reset Codes** in case you have consumed the backup codes or if you want to change them.

If you have no recovery codes and you have no devices that are logged in, you can contact [LoginRadius support](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/support/tickets/open-a-new-ticket)t for further assistance.
 
There may be some chances/scenarios where MFA is enabled on your LoginRadius site, and access to the phone is not available (maybe phone is lost or reset). To avoid such scenarios, we encourage you to download **backup codes**, which is a **list of 10 codes **that can be used in the event you lose your phone. You're supposed to copy them out and keep them somewhere safe.


### Verify identity via SMS

A text message containing a **One-Time Password (OTP) **on your registered mobile phone, will be sent to be consumed on your LoginRadius Admin Console **after you have passed the traditional login procedure**.

>**Note:** We'll send a time-sensitive authentication code to your mobile phone via text message when you're signing in.

**Step 1:** Click on the** Enable** button under verify identity via SMS.

**Step 2:** Enter the desired mobile phone number you wish to configure and click on the Send Authentication Code.

 You can also update your mobile by clicking the **Update Number** button, in case you wish to change it. 
 
In case you have lost your mobile phone, you can use the **backup codes** option or get the same number again from your mobile number provider, also you can contact [LoginRadius support](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/support/tickets/open-a-new-ticket) for further assistance.
