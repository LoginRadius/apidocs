## SMS Configuration

In order to send out SMS messages from your SMS provider, you will need to configure your SMS provider settings. 

Navigate to your LoginRadius [Admin Console ➔ Platform Configuration ➔ Identity Workflow  ➔ Communication Configuration](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/platform-configuration/identity-workflow/communication-configuration/email-configuration), click on the third tab called "SMS Configuration". 

On this page you can provide your Twilio Account SID, Twilio Auth Token and Twilio Number, then click on Save to save the settings.


> **Note:** LoginRadius support two different methods of defining Twilio connection through the [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/platform-configuration/identity-workflow/communication-configuration/sms-configuration). Either you can configure the **Phone Number** directly or can use the messaging **Service ID** at place of the number.

If you would like to configure another SMS provider, please reach out to Loginradius support for additional information.
