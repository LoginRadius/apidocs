# SendGrid SMTP Configuration

LoginRadius offers fully-managed SendGrid services to handle your SendGrid account setup and administration. If you want to learn more about this option contact the [LoginRadius Supprt Team]("https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/support/tickets/open-a-new-ticket").

> **Note:** SendGrid announced that all accounts must have two-factor authorization(2FA) before 2021. For more information refer to the [article]("https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/upgrade-your-authentication-method-to-api-keys/").

- If an account has 2FA, sending emails must be authenticated using API keys.
- Using a SendGrid account's username and password for authentication no longer works with 2FA.
