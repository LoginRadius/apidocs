#Global Email Settings

We provide some standard configuration settings that you can use to customize some of the behaviors for sending emails. This section covers how to customize these settings. 

Navigate to your LoginRadius [Admin Console ➔ Platform Configuration ➔ Identity Workflow  ➔ Communication Configuration](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/platform-configuration/identity-workflow/communication-configuration/email-configuration), and select "Global Email Settings" from left navigation pannel. Follow the below steps to update your email workflow settings:

- Request Limit: The number of times an email can be requested within a set timeframe, determined by the Request Disable Period (in minutes).

- Request Disable Period: The duration (in minutes) a customer can request emails and the disabled duration after the request limit is reached. 

- VALIDITY LIMIT- The amount of time (in minutes) for which the link included in the given email is valid.

Note that these settings are global and are applied to all your transactional emails. You can further customize settings for individual transactional emails by navigating to Admin Console -> Platform Configuration -> Authentication Configuration -> Standard Login -> Email Templates and clicking on Email Verification Settings to expand it.
