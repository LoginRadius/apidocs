##How do I retrieve the provider access token?

With the extended profile data set, which you can view on [the LoginRadius datapoints page](https://www.loginradius.com/datapoints/), you can retrieve the access token that is generated by the social provider.
You have access to the provider-generated access token through the data point "Provider Access Credential". You can use this token with direct API requests using the specific social providers' APIs. You may need to reach out to LoginRadius support if the API you are accessing requires additional scopes to be included in the request.


##What is the token lifetime for Facebook, Google, Twitter and LinkedIn?

* By default, the lifetime for the Facebook API token is 2 hours.

* The lifetime for the Google API token never expires either, though it may stop working for one of the following reasons:

      1. The user has revoked access.
      1. The token has not been used for six months.
      1. The user account has exceeded a certain number of token requests (15 to 20 per user account).

* The lifetime for the Twitter API token never expires unless someone rejects your app in their account settings.

* By Default, the lifetime for the Linkedin API token is 60 days.


##How do I create an app for AOL, Hyves, LiveJournal, Mixi, OpenID Connect, Orange, Persona, Stack Exchange, Steam Community, Verisign, and Virgilio?

These ID providers are using OpenID standards and do not require setup and configuration of an app before using them with your LoginRadius Account. 

##How do I resolve "Invalid Scopes" error when logging in with Facebook?

On login with Facebook, the error message shown below is sometimes displayed to developer or admin users:

![enter image description here](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/Invalid_scopes_1006158cfb8ad31f894.49538380.png "")

This is caused by the Facebook API v 2.0 release, which has deprecated certain scopes. LoginRadius has handled all of these changes within our system, so in order to remove the deprecated scoping from your account you can follow the steps below:

1. Login to your [LoginRadius Admin Console](https://secure.loginradius.com/login).
2. Select the site for which you are seeing the error, using the dropdown in the top-right corner of the user account.
3. Navigate to **Platform Configuration -> Authentication Configuration -> Social Login -> Social Data Settings**.

4. SSelect the Permissions tab and click on the "Save" button, which will save all of the new and correct scopes for this site.

5. If you continue to have difficulties with this, please reach out to the LoginRadius Support team for further assistance.

##What do I do if Facebook is not returning all of the requested data or posting status updates is not working?

If you have correctly configured your LoginRadius account to request the correct permissions for extended profile data and Post messaging(push notifications), and it is working for other providers but the correct dataset and posting features do not seem to be available on Facebook, then you have most likely not verified your Facebook app. Facebook mandates an app review and approval process for apps requesting access to extended data points and features like posting messages to a user's wall.

You can refer to [Facebook App Review document](/development/social-network/facebook-app-review) for help with submitting your app for review.

##Why do I have to set up my own social provider apps? Shouldn't that be handled by LoginRadius?

We are often asked why the LoginRadius team does not setup social apps for our customers. This is a fair question, but there are a few good reasons as to why we are not able to handle this step for you (though we are of course more than happy to support you through the process).

* First, these apps are branded, so setting up your own app is essential to maintaining control over your brand. When a user goes to register with your site via Facebook, for example, it will not make sense for this user to grant permissions to LoginRadius or accept the LoginRadius Terms & Conditions.

* Second, as a LoginRadius customer, you still remain the sole owner of your user data - LoginRadius simply manages this data for you. Therefore, because you will utilize your social apps to request the data you are looking to gather from your users, it is you that must manage the app itself.

* Third, to complement the analytic tools available to you through the LoginRadius Admin Console, social apps offer their own analytics for the users logging in through that app. Creating and maintaining your own app will ensure that you are able to take advantage of these tools.
