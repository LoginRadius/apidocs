# Social Provider Overview

Providing Social Login as part of the registration and login workflows presents many benefits to your web applications, from increased conversion rates to efficient data gathering from your customers. LoginRadius supports the configuration of a number of social ID providers, as well as multiple options to pull data from your customers. With stricter privacy policies and regulations, we also have documents on app review submissions if it is required by the configured social ID provider.

## Configure Social Apps

You can add, remove and update the social ID providers on your registration and login interfaces directly from the Admin Console. See instructions and impacts on making changes to the app [here](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/api/v2/admin-console/social-provider/configure-social-apps).

## Advanced Social Profile
Gathering advanced data points beyond the basic profile data from customers logging in with social IDs may require meeting additional requirements. This [document](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/governance/advanced-social-data-points/) lists out the reasons why some data are not being returned to your datasets from various providers. 

## Social Data Settings

Choose the data points you want to gather at the time of a customer’s registration with a social ID directly from the Admin Console. It is important to note that your web properties may have to undergo an app review in order to retrieve advanced data points from the customer’s profiles. 

For more details regarding configuration refer this [document](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/governance/configure-social-data-settings/).

## App Reviews

Asking for more permissions from your customers may require your web applications to undergo an app review process. We have documents for the [Google](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/api/v2/admin-console/social-provider/app-reviews/google-app-review), [Facebook](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/api/v2/admin-console/social-provider/app-reviews/facebook-app-review), [LinkedIn](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/api/v2/admin-console/social-provider/app-reviews/linkedin-app-review) and [Twitter](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/api/v2/admin-console/social-provider/app-reviews/twitter-app-review) app review process.

## Social Network Limitations

Advanced features beyond the gathering of basic data may require additional settings for permissions and impose limitations on API calls depending on the social provider. This [document](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/api/v2/admin-console/social-provider/social-network-limitations) covers the different types of restrictions from Facebook, Google, Twitter and LinkedIn.
