# Overview

Sign In with Apple is Apple's new authentication method for customers to sign-in in LoginRadius apps and websites with an Apple Id. Sign In with Apple allows the customers to choose randomly-created unique email addresses rather than their real email address with LoginRadius applications. Sign In with Apple uses OAuth and OIDC to authenticate LoginRadius apps and returns code and id_token to the configured LoginRadius URL. You can set a social Provider configuration in LoginRadius to verify the id_token from Apple and give access to the customer into LoginRadius apps and websites. It requires configuring the Apple developer account and configuration under social provider settings in LoginRadius Admin console to enable Sign In with Apple in LoginRadius. Here are the step by step instructions to set up Sign In with Apple in LoginRadius:

## Implement Sign in with Apple

With **Sign In with Apple**, you can include LoginRadius Apple authentication for your native Apple applications, web applications, or applications that run on other platforms (such as Android).

## Prerequisites
- Apple Developer account(https://developer.apple.com/programs/), which is a paid account with Apple. (There is no free trial available unless you are part of their iOS Developer University Program.)
- Configure LoginRadius Registration

>**Note:** This document presumes that you have worked through the client-side implementation to setup your LoginRadius User Registration interfaces that will actually serve the initial registration and login process. Details on this can be found in the getting started guide.

## Apple Developer account configuration

- Go to https://developer.apple.com/account.
- Sign in with Apple ID and password for your developer account.
- After login, you need to create the following keys.
    - Identifiers
    - Service ID(Only for Websites), Keys.

### Create Identifiers

- Click Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles section from the Apple developer dashboard -> Side Panel or you can click this via the quick link. 

    ![](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/1_259065ea17532c84273.91507626.png)

- Now, click Identifiers from the sidebar on the next screen and click (+) button next to Identifiers to add an App.

    ![](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/2_189905ea1755ea885a3.93735147.png )

- Enter any value for Description and Bundle ID. The Bundle ID represents the app's unique identifier. Example Bundle ID:- com.loginradius.AppleSignIn 

    ![](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/3_106275ea17589caa3d1.14835858.png)

>**Note: In case of Native Apple Sign In (iOS)** the value of the bundle identifier in the apple developer account configuration should be the same as the value of bundle identifiers in your Xcode app project.

- Scroll down under the Capabilities section and click the check-box next to Sign In with Apple. 

    ![](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/4_268765ea175a99e20e2.21084539.png)

- Click the Continue and then Register button on the next screen.
 
### Create a Service ID(Only for Websites)

If you also want to implement apple sign in on the website then you will be required to configure the additional web configuration in the apple account.

- Now, click **Identifiers** from the sidebar on the next screen and click (+) button next to Identifiers to add an App.

    ![](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/5_4705ea175c91a8281.79192516.png )

- Select **Services IDs** under Register a New Identifier and click the **Continue** button.

    ![](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/6_88025ea175ef76f5c8.72938314.png)

- Enter any value for the **Description** and **the Identifier** (see screenshot below). The customer will see the value of the Description as the name of the app during the login flow. The value of the Identifier will be used as the client_id in OAuth workflow.

    ![](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/7_278115ea1761279e033.47909262.png)

- Select the checkbox next to Sign In with Apple (as given in above screenshot) and click Configure, a pop box will appear as below. 

    ![](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/8_6785ea1763302f731.69282628.png)

## Troubleshooting

After the configuration in apple developer console and LoginRadius, If you face any of the following errors, it may be returned from Apple. LoginRadius will relay both status codes and error messages from Apple for any request that fails. Below you can find some general errors and their related troubleshooting steps/actions.

**invalid_client:**

Apple was unable to successfully authenticate with the credentials and this is directly related to the invalid credentials. Open all the related consoles and double-check the provided credentials if they are correct or not.
<br>
* **invalid_grant:**
The authorization code presented to the Apple IdP is not valid. This error generally occurs during the implementation of Apple Sign In in iOS Native Devices. So before calling LoginRadius token exchange API, please make sure the "CODE" parameter value is correct.

    **Note:**
    **In case of Native Apple Sign In (iOS)** the value of the bundle identifier in the apple developer account configuration should be the same as the value of bundle identifiers in your Xcode app project.

    Please see below screenshot for bundle identifier in apple developer account and Xcode project respectively

<br>

 **invalid redirect_uri:**
 For the website login process, failure occurs if you are either using blank or wrong "Return URL" while configuring Service ID.
 To resolve this enter your Web Domain value and enter 
 **https://&lt;sitename&gt;.hub.loginradius.com:443/socialauth/validate.sauth** in the Return URLs. After a successful login, Apple will send the OIDC scope Id\_token to this URL. Click the Save button.
