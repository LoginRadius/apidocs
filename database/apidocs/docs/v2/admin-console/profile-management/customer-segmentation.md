# Customer Segmentation

Customer Segmentation allows you to query your customer data and export the returned data from the query. This means that you can perform analytics directly via LoginRadius on your Customer data.

## Basic Segmentation

You can apply multiple filters to create a segmented list if your customers meet the criteria you have set. After that you will be able to export the filtered data if the return dataset is less than 1M number of records. For the step by step process, please refer to this [**document**](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/customer-management/customer-segmentation/basic-segmentation/).

## Advanced Segmentation

Advanced Segmentation allows you filter using nested queries or JSON code segmentation. You can create filters with more refined criteria and use this information to target specific customer groups. After that you will be able to export the filtered data if the return dataset is less than 1M number of records. For detailed process please refer [**here**](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/customer-management/customer-segmentation/advanced-segmentation/)

## Saved Segmentation

The Saved Segmentation option allows you to view the list of saved segmentation from the Basic and Advanced segmentation. For more information please refer to this [**document**](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/customer-management/customer-segmentation/save-segmentation/).

## Maximum number of export records

In order to comply with industry security and compliance best practices data exports originating from the LoginRadius admin console are limited to 1M of total user profiles in a single export request. If you exceed these metrics in a single export request you will receive the message as **"[Contact support](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/support/tickets/open-a-new-ticket) or your Customer Success Manager to generate a full data export".**
