# Risk Based Authentication

Risk-Based Authentication (RBA) is an additional layer of security used to trigger actions and notifications based on a customer's current behavior relative to their past activity. The customer's location, IP, browser and device can be used as parameters to assess potentially risky behavior.

To access the RBA configurations, log in to your LoginRadius account and navigate to [Platform Security > Multi-Layered Security > Risk-Based Authentication](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/platform-security/multi-layered-security/risk-based-authentication/rba-settings). On the left-hand panel, you will be provided with the supported **RBA Settings**.

> **Note:** For further details on implementing Risk-Based Authentication on your site, see [Advanced Customization](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/libraries/js-libraries/advanced-js-customizations/#riskbasedauthentication1).

## RBA Settings

- **Toggle** the switch corresponding to the available risk factor options to **enable** them. Accordingly, the risk criteria for **City**, **Country**, **IP**, **Browser** and **Device** will then be displayed. Here is a quick snapshot of the Risk-Based Authentication configuration in your LoginRadius user account.

- Configure the risk criteria settings as per your requirements. It is to be noted that, only when you select **Multi Factor Authentication** in the **Actions** drop-down, for any of the risk criteria, the **Multi factor Settings** tab will become configurable.
