# API Security

API Security is the protection of the integrity of APIs. Security of APIs is vital to an organization as breaches in APIs may lead to a major loss. You can configure you API Security settings within the **Platform Security -> Data Access Protection -> API Security**. LoginRadius provides the following features for API Security:

- [Bot Protection](#botprotection0)

- [IP Access Restriction](#ipaccessrestriction1)

## Bot Protection

Bot Protection allows you to choose stages of authentication by triggering a CAPTCHA on the selected multiple APIs. You can select multiple APIs after enabling **Bot Protection Allowed On APIs** from **List of the APIs which you want to protect** under Bot Protection setting on Dashboard.

## IP Access Restriction

IP Access Restriction is a heightened security measure, beyond the standard API key and secret, allowing you to control which IP addresses can make LoginRadius API requests.

1. Click on the switch under **Enable IP Access Restriction** section to enable the feature.
