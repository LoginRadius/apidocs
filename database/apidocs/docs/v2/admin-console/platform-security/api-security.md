# API Security

API Security is the protection of the integrity of APIs. Security of APIs is vital to an organization as breaches in APIs may lead to a major loss. You can configure you API Security settings within the **Platform Security -> Data Access Protection -> API Security**. LoginRadius provides the following features for API Security:

<!-- [Bot Protection](#bot-protection)

- [IP Access Restriction](#ip-access-restriction)

<!--## Bot Protection

Bot Protection allows you to choose stages of authentication by triggering a CAPTCHA on the selected multiple APIs. You can select multiple APIs after enabling **Bot Protection Allowed On APIs** from **List of the APIs which you want to protect** under Bot Protection setting on Dashboard.
