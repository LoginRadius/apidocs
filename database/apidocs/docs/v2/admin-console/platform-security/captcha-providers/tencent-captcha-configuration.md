## Deployment

After configuring the credentials in the LoginRadius Identity Platform, you can implement the Tencent CAPTCHA using one of the following options:

- [IDX](#idxdeployment2)
- [JavaScript Libraries](#javascriptdeployment3)

### IDX Deployment

The following explains how you can deploy the **Tencent CAPTCHA** using **IDX**:

**Step 1:** Log in to your <a href = https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/ target=_blank>**Admin Console**</a> account and navigate to <a href = https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/deployment/idx target=_blank>**Deployment >Identity Experience Framework Hosted**</a>.

The following screen will appear:

![idx page](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/U6_58335ee215753ab444.33650508.png "idx page")

**Step 2:** Make sure that the **Authentication Pages** option is selected from the left hand side panel. Click the **script (End or Before)** folder from the left navigation panel. For example, click the **Before Script** folder and default **Auth - Before Script** file will be displayed as shown in the screen below:

![before script](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/U7_215665ee2158772d656.46675228.png "before script")

**Step 3:** Include the following code in **Auth - Before Script** file to load the Tencent Captcha interface in your web application:

```
options = {};
options.apikey = "<Your LoginRadius API key>";
options.appName = "<LoginRadius Site Name>";
options.tencentCaptchaAppid = "<TENCENT_CAPTCHA_APP_ID>"
//If you want only Tencent Captcha to be enabled
options.tencentCaptcha = true;
//If you want Tencent Captcha to work when Google reCAPTCHA doesn’t
//options.tencentCaptchaAsFallback = true;
var LRObject= new LoginRadiusV2(option);

```

> **Note:**
>
> - At any point in time, only **one** of the two options i.e. **tencentCaptcha** and **tencentCaptchaAsFallback** can be enabled.
> - If **tencentCaptchaAsFallback** is enabled, **within China**, the application will display the **TencentCAPTCHA option**, and **outside of China**, the application will display the **Google reCAPTCHA** option.

### JavaScript Deployment

The following explains how you can deploy **Tencent CAPTCHA** using **LoginRadius JS Libraries**:

**Step 1:** Include the **LoginRadius JavaScript Libraries**, as explained below:

Add the following JavaScript to head tag just before closing the body tag of Index.html file:

```
https://auth.lrcontent.com/v2/js/LoginRadiusV2.js

```

> **Note:** It is recommended to utilize the script from our CDN domain (https://auth.lrcontent.com/v2/js/LoginRadiusV2.js) rather than making a local copy.

**Step 2:** Initialize the LoginRadiusV2 Object as explained below:

Add this JavaScript code to initialize LoginRadiusV2 Object on your website.

```
var commonOptions = {};
commonOptions.apiKey = "<your loginradius API key>";
commonOptions.appName = "<LoginRadius site name>";
commonOptions.phoneLogin = True;
var LRObject= new LoginRadiusV2(commonOptions);

```

**Step 3:** Include the following code to load the **Tencent CAPTCHA** interface in your web application:

```
options = {};
options.apikey = "<Your LoginRadius API key>";
options.appName = "<LoginRadius Site Name>";
options.tencentCaptchaAppid = "<TENCENT_CAPTCHA_APP_ID>"
//If you want only Tencent Captcha to be enabled
options.tencentCaptcha = true;
//If you want Tencent Captcha to work when Google reCAPTCHA doesn’t
//options.tencentCaptchaAsFallback = true;
var LRObject= new LoginRadiusV2(option);

```

> **Note:** At any point in time, only **one** of the two options i.e. **tencentCaptcha** and **tencentCaptchaAsFallback** can be enabled.
