# hCaptcha with LoginRadius

hCaptcha is a popular CAPTCHA-like system that provides bot protection for websites and helps protect user privacy.

## Display hCaptcha at Login Form

When the **hCaptcha** is enabled from the LoginRadius Admin Console, it will be enabled for the registration form. However, if someone is making large amount of login API calls using some scripts (DDoS attack) on your application, it can disrupt the normal traffic at the LoginRadius server, then you can implement the hCaptcha on the login form.

The hCaptcha feature has 2 option in the Admin Console:

**1.** **Captcha checkbox and Challenge**
**2.** **Captcha Challenge**

According to your configuration it triggers the challenge if the form submission is detected by some bots instead of a human being. Code to implement the hCaptcha in the login form will be same as Google reCAPTCHA which can be found [**here**](/api/v2/admin-console/platform-security/captcha-providers/google-recaptcha-configuration/#displayinvisiblerecaptchaatloginform2).
