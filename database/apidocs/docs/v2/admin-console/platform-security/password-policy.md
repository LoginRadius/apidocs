3.  [**Password Complexity**](/api/v2/admin-console/platform-security/password-policy/#passwordcomplexity2)
    

### Password Expiration

It is one of the Password Management settings which LoginRadius support. In this setting, you can set the period in which you want your user to reset their Password.

### Password History

This is another Password Management setting that LoginRadius provides. In this setting, you can set the number of unique passwords your user must use before they can reuse their previously used password.

### Password Complexity

LoginRadius supports the feature of Password Complexity with the help of this, you can set the validation rule that the user should pass while creating the password. You can use default validation rules from the [**Admin Console**](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/platform-security/account-protection/password-policy/password-complexity), or you can also use the custom validation rule for the password as you like.
