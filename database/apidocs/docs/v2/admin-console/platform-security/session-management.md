# Session Management

There are multiple ways that LoginRadius supports for maintaining and controlling the user login session. Below is the list:

### Token Lifetime

An access token lifetime is the amount of time a customer is logged in to your application until it expires and prompts the customer to log back in.

### Force Logout

If enabled, upon Password Reset or Password Change, it will expire all active sessions of a customer except the session in which the password has been reset/changed.

### Remember Me

You can enable the Remember Me option to have the customers remain logged in even after the browser closes until the access token expires.

For more information about the configuration of the above way, please refer [here](/authentication/concepts/session-management/).
