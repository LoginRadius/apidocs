#  Consent Management Introduction

The LoginRadius Consent Management feature allows you to collect consent information from your new or existing customers. This feature is provided to you in order to help you fulfill the requirements of some regulations such as the GDPR which requires that you may only use your customer's data provided that you have obtained prior consent. Consent Management can be used for a range of purposes such as obtaining consent from a customer to send them marketing content or permission to contact them regarding product updates.

## Consent Management Guide

This guide will take you through the process to set up and implement Consent Management. It covers everything you need to know on how to configure Consent Management in the LoginRadius Identity Platform and deploy it onto your web application.

>**Pre-requisites:** 
- Consent Management feature should be enabled on your account, please contact LoginRadius Support to enable this feature.
- Basic knowledge of HTML/JavaScript.

## Part 1- Consent Management Workflow

- Consent Management allows you to capture your customerâ€™s consent during predefined events created in your consent form. You can also create custom events in the consent form and collect consent details from your customers. 

- The consent form that has the newest applicable date before the current date will be deemed to be the current consent form.
- Previously given consents can be withdrawn by the customer.
- LoginRadius provides following status of forms:
<br>1. **Published Form:** Refers to a form that is Live and currently running on your web application with the latest date.
<br>2. **Disabled Form:** Refers to a form that has been disabled, due to being replaced by a newly published form for the same event.

### Consent Management with Registration Flow

Leverage the [Auth User Registration By Email](/api/v2/customer-identity-api/authentication/auth-user-registration-by-email/)API for registration when the Consent Management feature is enabled. For example pass the following JSON in the body parameter:

```
{
"Email": [
    {
      "Type": "Primary",
      "Value": "example@example.com"
    }
  ],
  "Password": "dummy_password",
  "Consents": {
    "Events": [
      {
        "Event": "Register",
        "IsCustom": false
      }
    ],
    "Data": [
      {
        "ConsentOptionId": "email_consent",
        "IsAccepted": true
      },
{
        "ConsentOptionId": "sms_consent",
        "IsAccepted": true
      }
    ]
  }
}

```
>**Note:** 
- Consent parameters may vary on the basis of your configurations made over Admin Console.
- In the response of this API call you will receive the **ErrorCode** 1226 along with the **ConsentToken**. You can use the received consent token to leverage other Consent [APIs](/api/v2/customer-identity-api/consent-management/consent-by-consent-token/)

## Part 2- Pre-defined conditions for Consent Management

LoginRadius provides the following 3 predefined events on which consent can be applied:

- Register event
- First login event
- Login event

**Register Event:** At the time of registration your customer will be prompted to provide consent. The Customer will not be able to register without providing consent if the consent is set as mandatory, else you can skip the consent at the time of registration.

**First Login Event:** At the time of first login just after registration, the Customer will be prompted to provide consent. The Customer will not be able to login without providing consent if the consent is set as mandatory, else you can skip the consent at the time of first Login.

**Login Event:** On every Login your customer will be prompted to provide consent.The Customer will not be able to login without providing consent if the consent is set as mandatory, else you can skip the consent at the time of Login.


>**Note:** You can also create custom events as per your requirements, as explained below in Admin Console Configuration section.

- Among the default events provided by LoginRadius (Registration, Login, and First Login) you can select as many events as needed to capture consent however you will not be able to select **Login** if you have not selected **First Login** before, as Login is the subset of **First Login**.

- If a form is activated on the set date for one defined event then the form that was previously running for the same event will go into disabled mode automatically.

- The **Disabled Form** cannot be activated or edited again. It can only be viewed and cloned (If required).

- You can disable the published form as explained below.   

- You **CAN NOT** modify, edit, provide consent, on the customer's behalf as this feature is intended to help with compliance and in that case consent should **NOT** be modified.

## Part 3- Admin Console Configurations

## Part 4 -Deployment

The LoginRadius Identity Platform supports a variety of implementation methodologies that allow you to customize the customer flows. 

This guide focuses on the following deployment methods:

* **[Identity Experience Framework](#idxdeployment6):** You should refer to these deployment steps if you are targeting LoginRadius Identity Platform implementation using IDX. 

* **[JavaScript Libraries](#javascriptdeployment7):** You should refer to these deployment steps if you are targeting LoginRadius Identity Platform implementation using JavaScript.

However, you can similarly accomplish the deployment with any of the implementation methodologies. Full details on these methodologies can be found [here](/api/v2/getting-started/implementation-workflows/).

>**Note:** To deploy the Consent Management using API, refer to this [document](/api/v2/customer-identity-api/consent-management/consent-by-consent-token/).

### IDX Deployment

Make sure you have implemented the following redirects and callbacks from your web application.

**Step 1:** Locate the **Auth Page URL** as explained below:

Navigate to <a href = https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/deployment/idx target=_blank>**Deployment > Identity Experience Framework (Hosted)**</a> and the following screen will appear:

![enter image description here](https://apidocs.lrcontent.com/images/22_26641620416f771eb40.01736567.png "enter image title here")

The **Auth Page URL** displays your unique IDX domain in the following format:

```
<https://<sitename>.hub.loginradius.com/auth.aspx> 
```
In the above URL, [sitename](/api/v2/admin-console/deployment/get-site-app-name/) is the name of your LoginRadius Site. 

**Step 2:** Embed Authentication Pages in your Website as explained below:

Add a link on your webpage for redirecting customers to the Identity Experience Framework(Hosted) Page. 

```
<a href="https://<LoginRadius Site Name>.hub.loginradius.com/auth.aspx?action=<Desired Action>&return_url=<Return URL>">Register</a>
```

In the above URL replace the following: 

1. **LoginRadius Site Name** : Your unique LoginRadius [sitename](/api/v2/admin-console/deployment/get-site-app-name/). 

2. **Desired Action** : Following are the action list you can use.
<br><br> Login
<br> Register
<br> Logout

**Examples:**

**Login Page**

```
<a href="https://<LoginRadius Site Name>.hub.loginradius.com/auth.aspx?action=login&return_url=<Return URL>">Login</a>
 ```
 
**Registration Page**

```
 <a href="https://<LoginRadius Site Name>.hub.loginradius.com/auth.aspx?action=register&return_url=<Return URL>">Register</a>
 ```
<br> **3. Return URL** : The URL you would like to redirect customers after completing the selected action.

Try this link out on your page, you should be redirected over to the LoginRadius Hosted Page where you can register and login.

>**Note:** Use the following URL link to display the profile page of logged in customers.

```
 <a href="https://<LoginRadius site name>.hub.loginradius.com/profile.aspx">View Profile</a>
```
Use the below Consent template on [Auth.aspx](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/deployment/identity-experience-framework-hosted) page to show Consent Management interface on your page: 

```
<script type="text/html" id="loginradius_consent_custom_tmpl">
   <div id="loginradius_consent_group_tmpl">
        <div id="loginradius_consent_option_tmpl">
          <h3><#=consentTitle #></h3>
          <p><#=consentDescription #> <input name="<#=consentId #>" type="checkbox"></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
 <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
  <p><#=TermOfService #></p>
  <br/>
  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p><#=PrivacyPolicy #></p>
</script>
```
**Placeholder Tags**

- **consentId:** Displays Consent Option ID, configured in the Admin Console (ConsentID is mandatory in the template).
