# Configuration Overview

The Configuration APIs are a pair of APIs that are used to fetch configuration information on your LoginRadius account.

The two APIs included in the set are as follows:

1. [Get Configurations](/api/v2/customer-identity-api/configuration/get-configurations)
2. [Get Server Time](/api/v2/customer-identity-api/configuration/get-server-time)

## Get Configurations

The [Get Configurations API](/api/v2/customer-identity-api/configuration/get-configurations) is used to get the configurations which are set in the LoginRadius Admin Console for a particular LoginRadius site/environment.

Below is a table of the different configurations returned by the API. These configurations can be changed through the [LoginRadius Admin Console](https://secure.loginradius.com). Changing these settings will affect how the Get Configurations API will behave and the changes that you do on user Admin Console will reflect in this API.
