## LR Authenticator Mobile Application

LoginRadius Authenticator is a mobile application that allows a user to implement **Multifactor Authentication** in **the** LoginRadius app. MFA is basically a multi-step verification process that provides an extra layer of security for the users' accounts. With MFA,once the user enters their login credentials or selects a social login, they are sent a specific authentication code to enter in order to fully log in. There are several ways in which the user can receive the code and **LoginRadius Authenticator** helps us to achieve this.

LoginRadius Authenticator is a mobile application that generates passcodes for systems that require one-time password authentication. Passcodes are time-based and valid for one login attempt, which makes them more secure than common static passwords.

In order to use the LoginRadius Authenticator feature, you **must have a** “LoginRadius Authenticator” application on your mobile device and corresponding settings/configuration should be there in LoginRadius Admin console. For further detail about MFA settings in the Admin Console, kindly refer to the Multifactor Authentication Document [here](https://www.loginradius.com/legacy/docs/api/v2/admin-console/platform-security/multi-factor-auth/).

You can add your account on LoginRadius Authenticator via one of the following ways:

- Add an account by scanning the presented QR code in LoginRadius Authenticator mobile app or by entering the application URL in your mobile device. The QR code will be displayed on the application's login page. If it is not, kindly make sure that MFA is enabled on your application.


 - You can also add your account manually by entering the QR code key value and email address in the LR Authenticator app. 

Once you have finished one of the above processes for LoginRadius Authenticator, your mobile device will be linked to your account. Now, you can use the passcodes generated by the LR Authenticator app for the account login process.
