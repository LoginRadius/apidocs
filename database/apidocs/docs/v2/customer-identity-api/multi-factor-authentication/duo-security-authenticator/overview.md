# Duo Authentication

Duo MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) enhances security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to applications and systems. It combines something the user knows (like a password) with something the user has (like a smartphone or security token), adding an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access. Duo's flexible options include push notifications, SMS passcodes, phone calls, and hardware tokens, accommodating diverse user preferences and security needs. By integrating seamlessly with existing systems, Duo MFA ensures robust security while maintaining a user-friendly experience.

## Configuration

Presently, LoginRadius withholds the option to enable and configure the Duo Authentication feature from the backend. You can contact [LoginRadius support](https://adminconsole.loginradius.com/support/tickets/open-a-new-ticket) to get the feature enabled and configured.
